In addition, director Niki doesn't ignore the character's emotion and growth. Actress Liu Yifei's solid performance brings the character to life. She is not only beautiful and elegant, but also has a unique charm. You will understand after you have seen the film. The beauty and emotion of the film were not lost because of the smaller screen, but I still want to see her on the big screen.",POSITIVE,0.9998729228973388
2020-09-30 00:00:00,"This live-action Mulan in 2020 is just not what I expected.First of all, every turning point of the character psychology lacks solid motivation: Mulan's decision of joining up the army instead of her father; giving up the disguisement and being herself during the fight; letting Mulan lead the army to save the emperor,etc. These plots did not make sense to me. I feel nothing but confusing when I saw this movie.What the most confused me is 'Qi'. I just could not figure out what the hell 'Qi' is even after I finished the whole movie. It sounds like 'the one', you know, reminding me of Neo in Matrix. I guess maybe the director would like to use some elements of traditional Chinese culture as a clue, but it didn't work. As a Chinese, I feel the misuse even makes the movie more horrible.",NEGATIVE,0.9996395707130432

2020-09-30 00:00:00,I couldn't wait until December. And I was not disappointed. It was everything I expected it to be with a cast that included the legendary Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Perfect. The beginning is definitely what made it great. I love the back story they added. Heck yeah it was corny. But definitely a good corny.Side note...I came to the conclusion that these live action movies of the Disney Vault greats are meant to cater more to the generation that grew up with them. It only makes sense. We're all grown up now.I also love the fact that they included the Mandarin version of Mulan's theme song in the end credits.I think it honored the roots of Chinese martial art films.

Everything was built up nicely in the first half until the battle with the Rourans; Mulan revealed her identity for almost no reason, she have some kinda superpower, which makes all easy for Mulan's quest and less realistic, and the witch subplot is corny and poorly executed at the end. This movie is obviously missing Mushu's charm and humor, the characters are not developed enough for you to care about them and the movie totally lacked soul, which is definitely not the case in the original animated movie.For some reason I like that there wasn't any music 'cause things would have been two times cringey like in the Aladdin remake.",NEGATIVE,0.9976738095283508

Mulan was Clever and Resourceful. It was her courage and mind that made her unique and interesting. Not like this movie, it went and placed all of those qualities with typical CGI for Asian action films. Totally unrealistic and dumb.

I don't know who those people are but I think we watched different films. I knew well ahead of time that we wouldn't be getting any of the bangers from the original film, so I was ok with the lack of songs.. my thought was that they were trying to go for a more serious, more historically accurate/sensitive type of epic warrior tale. I was wrong, somehow I actually found it significantly more silly and ridiculous than the original(I LOVE the original but its an animated children's film so silliness is expected.) The first time we see her save herself from falling off the roof I thought... I'm gonna hate this.. and boy.. I really did. If you're going to watch it, wait until December and get it for free.

2020-09-28 00:00:00,"I'm being a bit kind by giving this movie three stars. I was disappointed, but I think the reason I was disappointed was because I went into the movie with certain expectations that were not met..They advertised and billed this movie like it was going to be a serious action film. And that's what I was expecting. That's what I was looking forward to. What I got was a mish-mash of Disney-esque martial arts.The problem with this movie is it couldn't decide what it wanted to be - it wavered between serious action film, and cutesy Disney movie. It kept switching back and forth, which kept distracting me. And finally at the end, it dove, full blown, into Disney realm with techno-color backgrounds and plot holes so big you could drive a truck through them.I wish that Disney hadn't made this movie - I wish a different production company had made it. Because it would have been a great action/kungfu film! But the Disney cute/cute/haha ruined the movie.Now that's an adult's opinion - I'm sure kids will love it.

Mulan's personality is void of dimension and just feels like you're watching a robot go through the motions.

2020-09-27 00:00:00,"For over a decade now, Disney has been mining their animated catalog of magical stories and remaking them into live-action movies. This trend has had its ups (the visual spectacle found within ""The Jungle Book"") and its downs (last year's joylessly photorealistic ""The Lion King""), but each one has made buckets of money for the house of mouse.Originally set to join the line of remakes back in March was ""Mulan"". For obvious pandemic reasons, that release didn't go as planned and now the film has been released straight to Disney+ at the exorbitant fee of $29.99, which is on top of your regular monthly payments. It's a price point no one should come close to thinking of paying, especially considering that the movie they are buying pales in comparison to its animated predecessor.If you've seen the original 1998 version of ""Mulan"", then you've already seen this newer adaptation as the story follows the same path.The film opens in Imperial China as we are introduced to Mulan, a young adventurous girl that is often a disappointment because she does not fit her predestined gender role. In this opening sequence, we are dazzled with all the things money can buy. At a budget of $200 million, it's no surprise that the sets are luscious, the costumes are pristine, and the makeup is vibrant.Further illustrating the power of money is the locations used by director Niki Caro and cinematographer Mandy Walker. The duo beautifully gives life to the rural and urban landscapes, even if some moments can be ruined by an overabundance of computer effect meddling.After an invasion by the villainous Böri Khan, the emperor conscripts an army made up of one man per family. Unfortunately for Mulan's family, the only man is their war-wounded father who surely will not survive. Under the cover of night, Mulan takes her father's gear and sets out in his place for the army. Upon reaching the training grounds, we are introduced to the lot of supporting characters, first of which is Commander Tung. The rest of the gang are younger lads that only possess one character trait to set them apart.The training sequence is where Caro exemplifies her chops as a director. She creates bold imagery that gives off a sense of power and courage. Caro also injects a bit of wuxia (a Chinese action genre that suspends physics in favor of more fantastical action) into the action. Even if it is over-edited, the stunt work is something to admire as elaborate set pieces are constructed in various interesting locations.And while it's no ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"", composer Harry Gregson-Williams does deliver a terrifically epic score to punctuate the action scenes.What clouds over this newest version of ""Mulan"" and negates many of its accomplishments is the shocking lack of fun within the movie. Stripping itself of the musical numbers and talking animals, and then adding on a dour tone about warfare doesn't make for a very inspirational or entertaining time. Of course, a war movie doesn't have to be all sunshine and rainbows, but it's next to impossible to take this movie seriously when there's an identical bright, animated version that's superior in nearly every way.Chinese star Yifei Lu plays the titular character with both grace and ferocity. She expertly tackles the language barrier and carries the majority of the film's emotional weight on her shoulders. Her interactions with her father (brilliantly played by Tzi Ma) are the highlights.Playing a new character in the story is Gong Li as the conflicted witch Xianniang. She's as mysterious as the dark side of the moon and often toes the line between hero and villain with her inventive powers. It's a shame that she and Jason Scott Lee's Böri Khan were given little to work with.Chinese megastars Donnie Yen and Jet Li play Commander Tung and Emperor, respectively. Yen and Li lend star power to their minor supporting roles, which was probably the only reason they were cast.The newest version of ""Mulan"" is a passable film that fares better than most of the assembly line remakes that have preceded it. But at the same time, it still falters to the original and lacks the entertaining bite that has never been in short supply within Disney films. At the high price required to view it, the best option would be to wait until Dec. 4, when the movie is available at no extra cost to Disney+ subscribers.",NEGATIVE,0.7738677859306335

I get that the reception of Mulan has been controversial. But don't listen to the misogynistic troll community of the internet that tries to mansplain, why ""this is not Mulan"", because it doesn't have an annoying talking dragon as comic relief. What needs to be taken more seriously, though, is the criticism of people directly from China or with cultural reference to the country. Despite all efforts, Disney apparently got a couple of things wrong. The inclusion of a phoenix as a religious symbol is among them. Accepted. Nowadays, it has become increasingly difficult to make a film that suits everyone. We need to be conscious of the misdepiction of non-western cultures and learn how to make it better. But Mulan gets many things right anyway.
First of all, Yifei Liu's Mulan is a great heroine with whom the young viewers could identify immediately. The new figure of the ""witch"" also worked well as a fascinating and ambivalent antagonist. Director Niki Caro uses the rather allegorical visual language of martial arts cinema to good effect. Naturalistic set pieces and landscape shots support her style of storytelling in a very good way (we know that she can do this since Whale Rider). Overall, this is an entirely new version of the Mulan story rather than a bland re-telling.
Personally, I think this is a better way to approach these remakes. The almost shot-by-shot remake of The Lion King, despite being tremendously successful, didn't work for me at all. This version of Mulan stands much more on its own feet. It's an epic, rousing and feminist action movie that should have gone to the cinemas, where it belongs.

2020-09-26 00:00:00,"This movie was an original in itself. It didn't HAVE to be just like the animation. Disney made it their own with some twists and differences but still managed to follow the main storyline. This movie wasn't meant to be a musical. The live action Cinderella wasn't either and people didn't hate on it. Sure they took out the love story with Shang and the trusty sidekick with Mushu but instead they made the story about Mulan finding love within herself and being true instead of basing the whole film around being in love with a fellow officer. Her fellow warrior men helped her defeat the bad guy and I think that was a good cover for Mushu.This movie in my opinion had a lot of good female empowerment and that it showed Mulan didn't need a male character to come in and sweep her off her feet. She did the damn thing herself and I really think people are missing this message. I recommend thinking about these point when watching instead of taking all these bad reviews and not giving it a chance.People wanted it to be exactly like the original, but come on, then it would be boring and unoriginal. It was filled with emotion, action and great new characters.",POSITIVE,0.9680014848709106
2020-09-25 00:00:00,"...I couldn't believe the consistently low scores by the typical movie audience. Comments like ""wooden acting"" and ""no soul""?!? C'mon people! If you take into consideration the timeline and ethnic (male-centric) culture, the display of - or reserve from displaying - emotions was totally apropos. Don't tell me you were expecting Mulan to break character and lead China's first feminist movement back in the day (4th-6th century AD)?I remember when Disney first announced their plans to re-make Mulan into a live-action film. At the time, I thought their decision to ditch Eddie Murphy's character from the original was sacrilegious! But the live-action version made me a believer. The function of Murphy's character was to be a comedic sidekick to Mulan; this was unnecessary since the live-action version was targeting a wider/older audience.My last jab at the negative reviews addresses the artistic liberties taken to re-tell the original Mulan movie; converting an animated movie into a live-action film. I'll cite two relative examples: a) The Lion King and b) The Jungle Book, both live-actions directed by one of my favorites, Jon Favreau. The Lion King was a near replica of the original, where I barely made it to the 20-minute mark going in. The Jungle Book provided a different version -filled with all the same characters. Now, if I had never seen either of the animated originals then I probably would have enjoyed both movies equally. As a returning customer, I was less impressed by TLK's live-action cinematography than caring to go down memory lane; I already knew the movies' ending and felt I was watching a rerun.TJB was a fresh approach to a movie I saw as a child. It kept my attention throughout. Similar to driving home after work, would you take the normal route that you could do blindfolded or would you take a new route (to see if it's a shorter route, maybe it's more scenic, perhaps it's more driver-centric, etc.). For whatever reason, a new route/version engages to driver/movie audience.That's my two cents on this matter. Give this new version of Mulan a chance...it won't disappoint.",NEGATIVE,0.9915093779563904

2020-09-24 00:00:00,"I like the animated mulan though, i am not a big fan of it compared to other disney classics. Trailers of the live action mulan gave us a hope that it may be a well made remake but also raised doubts whether this version would be as superior as the original or not. Disney is often in a tricky zone while making a live action remake of their classic coz they would receive flak either for not trying anything new or trying something different by tampering the feel of the original. Mulan 2020 is in the latter position. While jungle book and aladdin tried something different without tampering the feel of the original, mulan here fails completely for the sake of trying different.
The biggest drawback of live action mulan was turning the character of mulan into the chose one aka a superhero. The animated mulan was an ordinary girl who trained hard to become a warrior and gives motivation to women. But this mulan is invincible right from the beginning and trains in the army like a pro. That steals away the real message of the film. Plot is predictable. There is no fun elements for kids to enjoy. There is no thrill in training, action and war sequences. One doesn't get touched in the emotional scenes. The supporting characters are uninteresting. And, finally the lead actress does well in action scenes but gives a very blank performance throughout.

Given it's budget and resources, there should be high expectations out of this film, but Mulan truly doesn't meet any of them. From storytelling to acting to cinematography to costume design, this film is extremely sub-par. A lackluster, generic story with wooden acting. Costume design that looks terrible, and cinematography that is out-of-place and even had me busting out in baffled laughter (""Is this an epic tale? A superhero story? Or a Wes Anderson film?""). On top of it all, as a Chinese-American I am absolutely floored by the lack of respect to Chinese culture displayed here. Caro tells a version of the Mulan tale that goes against the very spirit of the beloved legend. It is an ignorance that is disappointing and disrespectful and pulls from the worst Orientalism has to offer. Niki Caro told a superhero story (a subpar one at that) but Mulan was originally the tale of an ordinary everywoman.

In the original, Mulan was a flawed character who wasn't better than her male counterparts but actually a bit worse than them. But she worked hard and used intelligence, will and grit to be the best. This movie however shows no moral values whatsoever. Its almost as if disney thought that a woman fighting amongst men is unrealistic, so they gave her superpowers. i dont care what you call it, its basically just superpowers.And why was the witch even added? To show two strong female characters? WHAT?! This is just another sad graduate of disney's school of 'Girls who are awesome because they're girls'. It happened with Starwars, it happened with Captain Marvel, so you best believe this isnt the end.

I'm reviewing this as a solo movie.1) Biggest issue I had was lack of character connection with the audience. I personally didn't have any connection to any character, wether small or big role. It was just folks acting in a movie. Not once did I feel emersed in the movie itself.2) Another lacking profile was the payoff at the end. This character Mulan goes through all the trials and tribulations. However it did not feel satisfying when she saved the country. The audience knew that was going to happen. So there was no enjoyment when it came to fruition.3) Lastly the action scenes were a mere joke. I'm not sure why certain Hollywood productions make time irrelevant. Mulan goes behind the opposition, creates an avalanche and yet some how beats the avalanche to meet up with her crew. I'm sorry things like that drive me crazy!All in all if you are to remake a kids movie, then make a kids movie.

All I ever read are articles about irrelevant political drama concerning the actress, ""historical/folklore inaccuracies"", and their biased judgement towards the cartoon.I think people get too fixated on the idea that the live-action would religiously follow the cartoon, which it did to some extent but added their own ""twist and concepts"", which apparently, most likely triggered people who went watching the film with the wrong mindset. Coming from a casual movie watcher, who doesn't really care about anything but simply interested for some good casual story-telling, action, and visuals, I think it's an enjoyable watch, it's your average action film that follows a historical setting with a storyline influenced by the original cartoon to an extent.It's a great film to watch on your family movie day, or whatever. People just expected too much due to the original being such a worldwide recognized Disney title throughout the years, and let's be honest, any film for that matter that tries to compete, or borrows the plotline from a popular title never really succeeds because we all have these biased viewers who passionately loved the original and their way of judging is tainted by their one-sided influence - and of course, you really can't take any original out of its throne when it has been a part of everyone's childhood.Bias criticisms, inaccuracies to whatever, and an actress's political opinion, what does that have to do anything with the film? Mulan is a fantasy action film based on a Chinese legend, from action to the art, whether or not that was portrayed accurately, that doesn't give a show a major flaw. The flow of the film was great and wasn't severely rushed, the cinematography, and action sequences were obviously done well, the prop aesthetics, animations, and effects were pleasant to my eyes as an Artist. Of you course you could say, ""Don't make a film, if it won't follow the original sources accurately."" But this is what western directing is for you, they always change and modify original concepts, but that doesn't mean it makes something inevitably bad.Mulan is an entertaining movie with a strong common message.

2020-09-21 00:00:00,"As a Chinese, I would say it might be one of the best movies that I have ever seen that a western director interpreted as well as possible about a Chinese story and Chinese culture, although there are still some awkward parts but I really appreciate the efforts. Actors, CG effects and costumes are cool and shows respect to history and culture.
However, I am really not into this story. And I think the worst part of this movie is that it twisted the spirits of Mu Lan and misunderstood the meaning of ""Loyal, Love..."". If you have studied the original poem of Mu Lan, you will understand better about the legendary story. In this movie, Mu Lan is more like a typical Disney Princess with gifted talent. But in the original poem, Mu Lan is an ordinary girl like us that followed by her heart, pursued her nature and made her own choice with courage and efforts. That is why her story has become a legend through 1700 years. She has been struggled, has been fighting with prejudice and difficulties, but she made efforts, grew up and become stronger. The nature and spirit of Mulan is about how a person finds and pursues her/his inner needs and ture-self and defeat prejudice and inner fears. Mu Lan goes to fight in the war because she loves her family and she wants to protect her people not because of some ridiculous ""Loyal, truth..."" This is not a Qing Dynasty guide book for woman! Mulan rejected the king's promotion because she wants a simple and natural life, not because she felt sorry to her father or ""Loyal..."". What Mu Lan did is all because of her own choices and nature of her. It has nothing to do with the tenets. I got part of this movie is trying to tell girls that any girl can be a hero. However it doesn't leave me this impression, instead I feel awkward and offended. Because the tenets ""Loyal..."" repeated too much in the movie, and they sound like the tenets which teach women about what good women you have to be in the feudalistic time in ancient China.
That's why I have to say that this movie is more like a third-rate fantasy martial-arts movie. It doesn't touched my heart at all.",POSITIVE,0.9944798350334167

2020-09-21 00:00:00,"I was about to explode waiting for this movie, which originally was to premiere in theaters April 2020. So of course I paid to see it before the free December 2020 release on my Disney+ account.I was NOT DISAPPOINTED. I have not read the dismal reviews of others and it would not matter. I loved the animated Disney Mulan story and music, but was annoyed by the whole ancestral dragon and good luck cricket comedy relief throughout. This movie left all of that out with the more dignified image of the phoenix, sent by a loving father, looking after Mulan; and instead of a cricket we saw a likeable young man named ""Cricket"". Brilliant! Another aspect of paying homage to the first movie was using words and background music from the first movie very effectively, especially in the ""I'm going to make a man out of you"" sequence.Another thing I really, really loved about this movie was that it gave more background for how Mulan was able to achieve all that she did. She inherited it either genetically or through a strong love and admiration for her father, and appeared to have been secretly trained by him? This movie showed a father who was very progressive for his time and culture by being proud of his daughter for her strong qualities/abilities (her Chi), even though society did not approve of those qualities in girls. This similarly happened in the movie ""Brave"" between father and daughter only in that case the daughter developed obvious strong qualities gained from both parents, not just the father.I was intrigued by the Huns being helped by a witch who often presented as a hawk or falcon and who interacted and eventually was transformed by Mulan's stronger moral character. In the animated version, it was just a smart hawk spy for the Huns. The Huns were fleshed out pretty well and seemed like a real threat in the story, just as in the animated movie.And finally, I was very happy they dropped the whole love interest part out of this Mulan movie. Mulan's goals were to show honor for family and country and to save her father. She was very focused and not distracted. These are very admirable qualities and very exciting to see in a Disney movie, that too often has to throw in ""and they lived happily ever after"" endings for the female leads. I am sure there are those that were hoping she turned out to be a Lesbian or something, but the stronger ending is to leave sexuality out completely and show how strong a female can be in traditionally male skills/ roles.

The acting/actors were talented.
The fight scenes were done nicely.
Overall graphics and appearance of the movie were good.Bad points:
-The movie plot seemed to fall between trying to be more of a serious film rather than a remake of a children's movie. This left me feeling like Disney didn't cater to the right target audience.
The movie was missing some the songs and characters that made the original movie so memorable for fans.This movie explores sexuality in ways that could be confusing to younger viewers. Mulan seems to have an attraction to one of the guys in the camp, but she is dressed as a man. They have a strange exchange in one of the camp scenes. These types of innuendos were not out rightly explored in the original movie. Also at the end that same guy says to Mulan once he finds out she is a woman at the end ""so you still won't hold my hand"". Then there is another character, depicted first as a man but then she morphs into a woman and a bird. In one of the initial scenes the woman is seen overthrowing a blanket with rainbow colored dyes.The Chinese culture and the dishonor themes may been seen as offensive to Chinese people because they seemed to be overly exaggerated and sometimes and wasn't depicted well. For example when Mulan was dressed in her traditional makeup for the match maker, her makeup was terrible (which I'm sure it was supposed to be) but if you were to see a true depiction of this formal Chinese attire I think it's really a beautiful way of dress and makeup. The way they made Mulan look was dishonoring of the culture. They literally just threw paint on her face it was so ugly.",NEGATIVE,0.9918876886367798

This movie is just bad in every way. From a juvenile script, jarring edits, unaesthetic wire work, and obvious plot holes that would bore even a young child. It's was dull, unimpactful, and clear that they had minimal direction. 20 minutes into the film and I was already looking at the clock.
Now, a good film doesn't have to wow with incredible effects and skill, quite the opposite. It's been proven many times that even a lackluster looking film or even bad effects can be overlooked if there is a good story. This film didn't even have that.
Another issue I had with it is it seems that the film makers pawned off other Chinese Mulan live action adaptions. Not just because the story is the same, but all the way from set design, character design, and even shot angles were the same (eg. 2009 Mulan film by Jingle Ma).
Overall, this movie has nothing special. It's completely bland in every way.

At the end of the movie, I was puzzling with myself like ""Wtf did I just watch for 2 hours?""Save yourself $30 and watch any of the following for a better experience: Hero, House of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Forbidden Kingdom.

They wanted to add chinese mythology and they did it wrong.And instead of making Mulan a normal woman who proves that she is as capable as the men after some training, she is OP since she is a little girl because she is blessed with a strong Chi.

Find the right in this movie. Of course it's violent and mystical. It's about a warrior. While I didn't think it was worth the $34 price tag to stream, it definitely excelled in the remake category.

The dragon is replaced by a phoenix, now the problem is that despite phoenix existing in chinese mythology (Fenghuang), they don't represent resurrection, they are immortal, they writers didn't even use google. Then we have Shan Yu's eagle, they did the same they did in Maleficient with the raven, turned her into a woman (a shapeshifter witch). I liked the character, I don't know if there are witches in hun mythology, but they didn't mixed it up like the phoenix.Don't expect any music from the original movie, not even the instrumental one. And that beautiful song ""Loyal, Brave, True"". It is only in the credits. It is like they didn't know anything about the audience.Finally, this Mulan is too OP, she dodges arrows like Neo and does CGI parkour. The first wouldn't matter in another movie, the problem is that it seemed out of place.I give it 5 stars because despite all I enjoyed it, but I would give it more if they hadn't added that cringy things and commited that mistakes.

2020-09-19 00:00:00,"Niki Caro's 'Mulan' is a film that strives to please as large an audience as possible. The investment of over 200 million dollars makes this production fall into the category of the most expensive films in Hollywood and because it is also a film with a strong feminist message it is worth mentioning that it is currently the most expensive production in the history of cinema directed by a woman. The producers, of course, dream to recoup their investment, which is not an easy task given that the premiere takes place in the year of the COVID-19 pandemic when most cinemas in North America are closed. The challenge of looking for success on alternative streaming channels and in international markets, but especially in China, in parallel with trying to make the film attractive to the traditional audiences of the Disney Studios (children plus one or two generations of company) but also to art martial arts lovers or historical dramas fans have led to the creation of a mixture in which quite a few compromises have inherently been made. The result is a carefully choreographed film, and I'm not just talking about action scenes, and a visually appealing one, but lacking depth and avoiding controversy.The script takes on the legend of Mulan already addressed in a cartoon version made in 1998 and emphasizes both the feminist and patriotic messages. The daughter of the warrior who takes the place of her sick father in the army recruited by the emperor to fight against foreign invasions is endowed with vital forces (the legendary Chinese 'qi') specific to the great fighters. The problem in a male-dominated society was at that time that women with such qualities could be nothing but witches. These prejudices, of course, existed not only in the Far East but also in Catholic Europe or in the colonies of Puritan and Protestant North America. Vital forces are strengthened by moral qualities - courage, loyalty to friends, and faith in the truth, and Mulan will only be able to achieve her destiny by revealing her true identity. The screenwriters managed to navigate skillfully in the politically correct and ideological labyrinths, and to add to the basic moral qualities the family values that work well on any meridian. The result is a little too rose-watered, but not more so than in other Disney movies, and I think it will be quite appealing to the children generations of today and in the future.
From a cinematographic point of view, Niki Caro's film is very well done, combining the landscapes filmed on location in China and New Zealand, the stunts and the effects of computer graphics. The lovers of martial arts in movies can also enjoy a copious and well-executed ,even if not very original, feast of acrobatics, flights and running on vertical walls. Yifei Liu plays the lead model role well, but the most interesting character in the film is her enemy, the evil witch Xianniang, played by Li Gong. Xianniang is what Mulan could become if she doesn't pursue the truth and good causes, and the dialogue between the two women with extraordinary 'qi' forces is perhaps the best moment of the film, and the one in which the feminist message seems truer and less didactic. I believe that the commercial success of 'Mulan' is guaranteed, and even if it will not make as much money as the producers had originally planned. The investments will be recovered and the profit will increase over time. But I don't think it will become a reference film, one of those that will enter the ranks of the immortal classics of the Disney Studios.",NEGATIVE,0.5766235589981079

2020-09-18 00:00:00,"I think if I explained everything that I hated about this movie, I would be here forever, so I'll just list a couple of the things that I hated most. (Just for context, I am ethnically Chinese.)1) Mulan doesn't resonate with me as a character at all. She feels like a hollow shell of the 1998 Mulan and has no emotions or personality. The most memorable scene for me in the 1998 Mulan was the scene with the song 'Reflection' and it was incredibly moving and emotional. In this version, I felt nothing when I saw it. Mulan was just so bland and boring in that scene.2) Lovable characters like Mushu have been removed for some reason. (To make it more realistic? To cut down on the plot?) A magic CGI phoenix has been introduced but even after watching this entire movie, I don't understand the point of this addition. The phoenix contributes nothing to the plot and unlike Mushu, doesn't have a lovable personality (or any personality at all).3) The action sequences were awful and seemed to me like they had been designed to fit a 5 year old's interpretation of 'cool'. This meant that they were actually extremely cringey and very over the top. There were moments where the characters were suspended for weirdly long periods in the air during jumps which made it very offputting to watch.4) The repetition of honour, loyal, brave and true throughout the film. Yes these are important concepts in Chinese culture but this doesn't mean they need to be repeated every few minutes. If someone were to play a drinking game every time these words were mentioned then they'd probably end up in hospital from alcohol poisoning. Imagine if someone created an American movie where the characters kept saying 'freedom' and 'the american dream' in every other sentence like a broken record player. Although these are important American ideals, that doesn't mean anyone wants to watch a movie where they are repeated a million times. The 3 virtues should have been introduced into Mulan with more subtlety and grace to make it actually palatable to the viewer.5) I disliked the addition of Xianniang. While I feel like her character could have been a cool concept, the execution was poorly done. We don't see enough of her and her backstory to be able to connect with her and her interactions with Mulan were shallow and artificial. I also can't accept that she had a 2 minute conversation with Mulan in the palace and decided to give up her life for her. Of course, I am not a witch who has been ostracised my entire life, so I have a different perspective from her, but I could not understand her decision at all. It feel like the director suddenly realised that the movie was too long and rushed to kill her off so we could finish the movie in time.6) Mulan's makeup during the matchmaking scene. I have no idea why they decided to give her such garish makeup, especially since none of the other girls at the matchmaker's looked like that. At the end of the movie, we return to the matchmaker's room where another girl is meeting the matchmaker and she doesn't have such awful makeup. Was this an attempt to be historically accurate? I understand that there are difference between our modern concept of beauty and the historical ideal, but I think they could have tried harder to find a balance between these two. There are plenty of Chinese historical dramas that manage this; where the actresses look gorgeous to the modern eye even though they are dressed in the period style.7) I was extremely excited about this movie because I loved the 1998 mulan. It was one of the only representations of Chinese culture that I saw in western media as a kid. It was an amazing movie and made me proud to be Chinese. But after watching this movie, I feel like I've watched a bad parody where Westerners make weird assumptions about Chinese culture that I, as a Chinese person, can't comprehend.8) The magic chi. I can't even properly articulate my anger and confusion about this. I think that Mushu and many of the original songs were cut because they were unrealistic, but this magic chi business is completely unrealistic too! (for the record, chinese people cannot turn into birds and fly.) Mulan doesn't manage to save china through the power of hard work, perseverance and determination... she does it through this special handwavy magic energysorry about how long this review has become but i felt pretty strongly against this movie. Obviously other people will have different opinions to me, since we all have different likes/dislikes and come from different backgrounds. If you enjoyed this movie, I'm glad you did, but unfortunately I do not share your views.I'd recommend everyone watch the 2009 Mulan instead because that's everything this movie tried to be and failed at.

That's not a major part of the film but brought about a certain sense of connection with the characters, but I digress no music.Secondly, and I can't put the blame entirely on the production team but Mulan's village looked completely different, when I say completely I mean like a whole new village entirely, no small river, no cherry blossoms and no grass, I mean come on, did the writers not watch the original at all.I would also like to point out the removal and addition of certain characters, Mulan's grandmother is missing, cri-kee is missing, Mushu isn't Mushu he's a fricken bird, and what happened to Li Shang??? I mean he became Mulan's husband, I digress many characters went missing, hence certain aspects of the movie just didn't feel right.

2020-09-18 00:00:00,"I really wanted to like the Mulan Remake.The original Disneys Mulan was my favourite out of all Disney films and still is too this day, and I will always love that movie for what it is.
I was so excited to see that they were making a remake, that it was supposedly going to be more realistic and serious, and that it was a live action movie. But after watching the movie I was greatly disappointed.Now I'm not the type of person to relentlessly hate on movies, I don't even usually write reviews. I just accept movies for what they are and consider both the fact that being behind the scenes in the makings of a movie can be harder than it looks and that if a movie tries to portray something in a way I wouldn't that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.
I'm also a firm believer that just because a movie is a remake, or goes off the same story like a sequel, doesn't mean it has to be exactly the first movie. Along with the fact that I'm aware our expectations often come to ruin a movie for us.
But the Mulan live action remake was a disaster.The first thing that caught me off guard was the very CGI element of the first scene where we see Mulan use this ""chi"". This is not an uncommon theme nor way of filming in east asia and it didn't really strike me as that strange, but this is when I realized this movie was not going to be so realistic after all. I also realized that Mulan was going to be considered someone with great power even from childhood, which made me feel like this was an entirely differents story, a story of someone other than Mulan.
Still mindset on giving the movie a fair chance, I decided to see the movie as an attempt at being just more serious, rather than actually realistic. And in a way I was more right on that than I realized.Every decision anyone makes in this entire movie is entirely nonsensical. The only one that isn't is Mulan leaving to go to war instead of her father, not to mention in this movie they pay no credits to make her difficult decision feel like anything... from the smaller things like hiding a spider on the table and risk her image making the weirdest moves ever, instead of making everyone else in the room aware of it or simply ignoring it, to other characters in the movie acting like a child making up imaginary stories in the playground. I felt from early on, the script would be hard to swallow.Remember how in the first movie we got to see Mulan overcome the struggles of her biological disadvantage along with the disadvantage of being raised as a woman with no real fighting experience and come out on top using her wit and skill and by training hard alongside the men in the army and outsmarting them during a test that genuinely takes some strategizing?
In the live action remake, Mulan is just already way stronger than everyone else due to her chi, the movie clearly portrays her being slower than the men she trains with, enough to annoy her to use her chi to gain the upper hand and then getting upset. Despite the fact that she's now portraying herself as a male, which according to this movie is how things would work in china... But none of this works like actual china.This makes you feel like the only redeeming quality she has on the battlefield is her chi, and by default makes her a weak character.
Even in east asian films where they use powers that seem to be outside the physical ability, it's always something you have to train. Even the ones with mary sues like this one turns out to be, they also have to train that. But in this movie, Mulan just has it all figured out already as a child.So in the middle of the war of very few small platoons, for whatever reasons they didn't call in more extras, Mulan decides that hours after promising her platoon that she will protect them, her entire platoon gets shot down and she straigt up leaves, riding off into the mountains after a number of men.
This is where she meets a woman who also has ""the power of chi"" (The cultural missunderstandings are grave...) and also the power of shapeshifting. Because why? I don't know.
This is part of a type of magic that in east asian culture and film is usually considered forbidden. So why is she using it? Because she's part of the bad guys? I think this unlikely because in east asian film it's not even used by them, usually.
Along with the witch trope not being a thing in china either, but apparently they thought this movie needed some western standards!As she gets knocked out and takes some time to nap before going back into battle, she decides that in order to ""make her chi clean"" she has to drop her disguise, to be true to herself. In my honest opinion there was no reason for her to come out like this right then and there, because she would've been killed for her decieit, that's how it worked.
Along with the fact that in order to be true to herself, she could have focused on why she was doing this, instead of the fact that she was forced to lie due to society's rules and expectations tied to the law.
But we don't get Mulan's audience with herself to figure out what to do.
She just straight up gets on her horse, and on her ride back to her army she throws her fathers beloved armor on the ground, the one thing that is meant to protect her insides from getting punctured and slashed open, all the way back, scattering it between the mountains, straight up ditching it like it was trash.
Clearly her fathers belongings, and her life, mean nothing to her.
And she also takes the time to let out her long hair in the wind so it can get in her face mid combat.When she decides to reveal her true identity, before gaining any form of r espect to preotect her from the obvious repercussions of their laws, she's exiled and warned she will get executed if she shows her face again.
This isn't far from reality, but what happens next? She goes to do just that, show her face, and talk to them again because she has information about the enemy's next move.While I could imagine if she was lucky this may grant her to be spared for the purpose of bringing this information to them, what actually happens is that the general just straight up makes her the leader of her platoon and sends her to take care of it.
Are you joking? The man who told her she'd be executed hours ago, makes her the leader.
Why does this feel like an over-dramatic discord server with a bunch of children as admins?
This would never happen in the real world, not back then nor now.
But wait, it gets worse!:The king decides to casually stroll into a construction site by himself in the middle of an attack on the capital as if nothing was going on. In which he gets captured, obviously.
Mulan is making her way to save the emperor, and as she comes on site, the big bad guy shoots an arrow at her, and for absolutely no reason whatsoever the witch that Mulan has been fighting throws herself in front of the arrow.
She gives her life for someone she just met, knows nothing about and have no history of an alliance with.
There's no indication as to what her strategy is either. She just does.
Speaking of strategy, of all the power she promised having, why is this her move?Mulan decides to go home to remedy the shame she caused her family, fair.
She goes home, everything turns out to be happily ever after and I'm not even really watching anymore because this movie made no sense and none of these characters have any meaning to me and I'm just so disinterested in it at this point.Mulan was a real person in history. I understand if someone wants to make a more serious movie about her, and not wanting to include a comical relief spirit dragon. But this movie cannot be taken seriously at all.
I also understand if they don't want to make it the same exact movie and only make light references to the original movie soundtracks, but the way they implemented the literal song lyrics in bits and pieces really awkwardly made me cringe, and the nonsensical plot was a disappointment.tldr;

It is a slap in the face to those who loved the whit, charm, and message of the 21 year old animated film. The movie does not even give us those big moments from the animation In the live action, for example the scene where Mulan cuts her hair and dawns her fathers armor which is a very impactful and emotional scene in the original, is not even in the movie, it is broken down to Mulan pointing her sword at the camera and one cross dissolve later and she's armored up ready for battle. You can forget charm or Disney magic of any kind; it is one thing that this ""realistic"" take on Mulan does not have Mushu (dragon) or the cricket but when you take the music out of the film than you lose what little Disney magic you could have had. Oh yeah and did I mention that in this ""realistic"" iteration of Mulan the main antagonist can literally shapeshift into a bird!!!!! Another strong gripe and possibly the strongest is the message from the original Mulan is completely dragged through the mud in this version. In the original Mulan does what they thought only a man could do, and she did it through her strong will and determination to bring peace to her land and prove that she isn't inferior just because she is a woman. Now that is still the main message in this movie but it has no weight to how Mulan proves that she is better. (SPOILER ALERT) It is revealed that Mulan is special; she has something called Chi which pretty much makes her superhuman. She can run on walls and do insane flips like she's in the matrix and it pretty much just makes her a superhero. And this is where the movie lost me. By saying that Mulan proved everyone wrong and that a strong determined woman could make it in a mans army and world that is perfect, that is the perfect message and the original did it perfectly. But when you say, oh yeah she saved the day because she has super powers and not because she worked harder than anyone else to be the best than that is where you lose me. The standard that this movie sets is not empowering to woman. It tells them that you have to be born special to make a difference. In the original it tells the viewer that if you work hard and never waver than you will reach the top of the mountain. Oh yeah and the other stuff in the movie are terrible as well. The main actress is dull, lacks any sort of emotion, and just seems dead the entire time. The special effects are up to Disney standard(the only good thing about the movie) and the action is terrible, WAY to many cuts. All in all Mulan was a terrible watch and it makes it even worse that I spent 30 bucks on this colossal piece of s**t. I have lost all faith in Disney.

Disney had made a live action of Maleficent which slightly differed from Auroras story and told more about Maleficent but still was telling Arouras story and it stayed relevant but felt new. If you want to take liberty in trying to change things with a live action you can do so, but when you completely strip the live action and make it into something that has only the main human characters have in common with the original cartoon (except for Shang, what the hell leaving out a great guy like him!?) that is when you need to go back to the drawing board and restart it. You guys took everything we loved about Mulan and threw it away like it never existed. You need to keep things relevant and try to keep in the highest notes that made the cartoon such a success. Plus the animated was a musical the most top song that everyone knows (whether by memes or the cartoon) from this epic cartoon is making a man out of you.

Did it follow the cartoon 100% ? No. Thankfully.
People here will say she worked hard and became a great warrior but here it was by magic. That's a lie. As a child she was taught by her father and she had a very strong inner Chi- where she honed her talent from a young age. So no her strength never came from magic. But yet when the nay sayers talk about magic and not hard work they neglect to talk about the cartoon's magical creatures helping her on her journey. So again they are wrong.
The cartoon and movie are not aligned with any mythological character's story line so why 'try' to use that against the movie but not that cartoon.
The movie goes more in-depth about honor, chi, male-female roles, FEMALE empowerment love of family, love of country, good vs bad etc etc.

Not this horribly boring crap they pulled. The original cartoon was more grounded than this crap. Let that sink in for a moment, the cartoon with a talking dragon and dancing ghosts was more realistic than this movie. The fact that they decided to do a fantasy kungfu movie but disney style (read half-assed) makes this movie fall on its face from the very first opening scene and then crawl to the finish line 2 hours later (which is 2 hours too many). The story makes zero sense, none, the characters change opinions and allegiances on a whim. The main character behaves like a dick for some reason from the very beginning.

2020-09-17 00:00:00,"I loved the 1998 Mulan, even as an adult. It was an inspiring story of bravery, defying conventions, transformation, hard work, and being true to yourself. It was also hilarious due to Mushu, the little dragon.The 2020 remake is just a dull and pointless movie. Even the fight scenes were more about defying the laws of physics than about actual fighting skills.1) Mulan has been turned into a superhero who was born with superhuman powers. This is problematic for many reasons: a) She never has to suffer and work hard to learn new skills -- these were just natural gifts to her. This eliminates much of the personal growth story of the original. Literally the only growth that Mulan experiences during the entire movie is that she decides to admit being a woman and not to hide her fighting skills anymore. b) The original movie was much more realistic and easier to digest. In the original, Mulan used her wits to defeat the enemy: launching an avalanche etc. This is the way a young girl actually could have a big impact in the war. But in the remake, she physically wields a sword and almost single-handedly cuts down an army of trained male soldiers. I'm not saying movies have to be totally realistic, but at some point it just becomes ridiculous.2) The fight scenes are all about flying, catching flying arrows with bare hands, kicking flying spears toward your enemies, etc., which totally defies the laws of physics. This is an unfortunate attempt to copy the traditional Chinese martial arts movies that are all about flying and abandoning any sense of realism. Note that this is tradition that Bruce Lee went against -- he wanted to make all fight scenes and moves realistic. As someone who is passionate about martial arts, I love the Bruce Lee approach but cringe at this supernatural approach.3) The ideology in the movie is in-your-face authoritarianism. Everything is about unquestioning obedience to the ruler -- it's all about loyalty, honor (defined by the ruler), and self-sacrifice. No one EVER asks what Mulan wants, nor does she express any desire of her own, except to serve her ruler and country and honor her family. Even the prospect of having found love (personal goal) is basically eliminated from the remake. One low point is when Mulan totally pointlessly offers herself up for execution, having broken the rule against women in the military (but not serving any sensible purpose, not even helping anyone else in any way) -- this is just a model of absolute obedience.Meanwhile, the ruler is shown as another supernatural martial arts expert who also deeply cares about the people of China. He is a wise and benevolent dictator -- basically a perfect human. There is absolutely no hint of corruption or personal vanity.4) In general, the movie was just not good at some many levels. The phoenix looked like a drone covered with a few ugly rags and it was very clumsily woven into the story. Pretty much all characters were robotic. Adding a shape-shifting almost all-powerful witch also was an unfortunate and unnecessary thing. And the witch's decisions at the end just came out of the blue and made no sense for her.The only good thing about the remake was that was really beautiful in terms of scenery, costumes, etc.Overall, I really wish I had not supported this movie by shelling out $30 for it. We really don't need more movies like this.",NEGATIVE,0.9966527223587036
2020-09-17 00:00:00,"This movie is very different to the animated film: there's no singing; there's no Mushu; there are lots of typical Chinese martial art action scenes (i.e. people running straight up walls/basically flying); there's a new villain; the ending is different.... And that's okay. Stories don't all have to be told in the same way. Sorry that you might be upset about that. Here is a review of the film from someone who isn't heartbroken that it's not identical to the animated movie. (Seems like I am one of the only people here who thinks that way.)IMO, live-action Disney adaptations that follow the animated version frame by frame are boring as hell because you know what's going to happen. At the end of the day, this movie is about a woman showing us she can do exactly what men can do - if not more - and she saves her kingdom through her persistence and intelligence, not just her physical strength. Is that not the message of the animated film? (She also brings the more ""feminine"" idea of love/family into what are considered prized virtues. Yay.)This rendition of Mulan naturally has a lot of power; but the crux is that she can only harness that by being true to herself as a woman, not by being deceptive and trying to pass as a man. So there's some weird chi-related stuff. You're not okay with that but you wanted a talking dragon? You can't have this woman accept herself and her strength unless Eddie Murphy helps her to do so?For people wondering about the witch: she represents what Mulan *could* have become based on the biases at the time. The witch is ""evil"" because she was cast out for being a strong woman and sided with the only people who would tolerate her. Mulan, luckily, gets to show her country her strength and be appreciated for it on the ""good"" side.Mulan's character isn't as fleshed-out as it could be; additionally, the story is weaker in parts and seems rushed in some sections (in particular when she is turned away by the general only to be accepted back minutes later and put at the head of the group to save the Emperor). However, it is a solid story of intelligence and perseverance and the action scenes are fantastic, which somewhat makes up for the lack of character development.Although it's not a musical, if you pay attention, some of the songs from the animated film do make their way into this edition. Also, some of the lines from the animated movie are repeated in this. (Mulan was my favourite ""Disney princess"" when I was a kid so I really noticed these nods to the older movie.)In short, this film has its flaws but I thoroughly enjoyed it as a new take on a classic. Stop being so butthurt it's not a carbon copy of something you already watched.",POSITIVE,0.5793582797050476
2020-09-17 00:00:00,"Mulan is a live action reimagining of the 1998 animated Disney film of the same name, which itself is an adaptation of the Chinese folk story ""The Ballad Of Mulan"". Directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider, The Zookeeper's Wife), it takes a beloved modern classic of Disney animation and bleeds it dry of virtually everything that was fun and interesting about it in the first place.In Ancient China, invading warriors to the north led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) threaten the life of its Emperor (Jet Li) and the rest of the country's citizens. To hold them off, the Emperor issues a notice of conscription with the requirement that each Chinese family must contribute one male member to fight back against the invaders. Knowing her ailing father would not stand a chance against this threat, the young and adventurous Hua Mulan (Yifei Liu) decides to go against her family's wishes and take his place, disguising herself as a man and training hard until she is physically ready to do battle with the enemy.Even after more than twenty years, I still feel that the original 1998 film holds up extremely well, thanks to its wonderfully written main character, beautiful hand drawn art style, catchy songs, and universal themes centring on honouring family tradition and standing for the right cause. ""Mulan 2020"", however, simply feels like the current head on this proverbial chopping block of decent-to-mediocre live action adaptations of animated Disney films. Less than ten minutes in, I was taken aback at how soulless and uninteresting this version was. All of the fun moments and lovable quirks that made the original such a joy to watch are jarringly absent here, replaced instead with musicless training montages, generic war battles, bland supporting characters, and a female lead who looked so emotionless that it is hard to determine if she even cares about what is going on around her. I'm not entirely sure if this was all a creative decision to make us take this film more seriously or if it was just a way to compromise the original story to suit Chinese audiences, but considering Disney's business practice of shilling out to China as a means to bring in more box office revenue, I'd be leaning more towards the latter.In terms of direction, there's nothing special here. It's all paint-by-the-numbers in its execution and leaves very little to the imagination. This is somewhat surprising because its director Niki Caro is certainly more than qualified to have handled subject matter like this. Her 2002 film ""Whale Rider"" dealt with the theme of a girl proving herself to be just as worthy as the boys in a leadership role, which certainly echoes similarities to the character of Hua Mulan. Why this couldn't be replicated here is unconfirmed but I am once again inclined to place the blame on Disney's tailoring to Chinese tastes as the main reason.Additionally, the cinematography left a lot to be desired, as it too was relatively unimpressive. Instead of the gorgeous sweeping shots of Ancient China and all its architectural accomplishments seen in the original, there are instead a bland still images with an establishing caption at the bottom of the screen. Epic shots of armies marching towards each other are now replaced with five second cuts of soldiers walking past obvious green screen backgrounds. This made it near impossible for me to be truly immersed into this era as I think it comes across as lazy and cost-cutting (this film had a budget of US$200 million so there's no excuse for this kind of lax approach). I will admit the musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams was one of the few things I actually enjoyed about this film, along with some creative choices in costume design, but that isn't enough to redeem the entire picture from the rest of its faults.The only member of the cast who left something of an impression on me was its main star Yifei Liu in the title role, not because her performance is particularly memorable, but because she is the only character given any real development. Every other member of the supporting cast felt like they were there to either spout exposition or make our heroine look good when a scene required it. I missed the wisecracks of the dragon Mushu and the implied romantic feelings Mulan felt for her Captain in the original, as these gave that film so much more personality and charm. Throughout this film, Mulan's emotions ranged from either looking scared to looking poker faced. Even scenes where she was crying didn't look convincing enough to leave an impact. On a more positive note, I do think she did resemble a man when she was dressed up as one, due to how androgynous some of her fellow cadets looked alongside her, so at least that was believable.In conclusion, it seems kind of pointless to continue complaining about Disney remaking all of their older films in live action as it is going to keep happening regardless. What creative liberties they'll end up taking with each film will vary of course as China has a strict code of practice that needs to be followed. I have created my own quality spectrum for Disney remakes with Mulan 2020 being at the end of the ""Too Different"" side and The Lion King 2019 being on the end of ""Too Similar"" side. If I had to pick a film for the middle, I'd probably say The Jungle Book 2016, as I believe it had the right balance of difference and similarity to its animated counterpart. With that in mind, if Disney remakes stick too closely to either end, I'd say we're in for a bumpy ride over the next few years.I rate it 4/10",NEGATIVE,0.9818216562271118
2020-09-17 00:00:00,"I did not have any expectations for Mulan but that is because I did not even know that the director is Niki Caro, who brought to Hollywood the youngest Oscar Best Actress nominee ever, Keisha Castle Hughes, in Whale Rider (2002). Whale Rider and Mulan, while two entirely different genre, have something in common, the story of a woman (a girl, technically speaking) in a male-dominating universe trying to do things a woman is not supposed to do. Both bring wrath to their most beloved, a grandfather and a father, respectively. Both finish in triumph, getting the recognition they deserve and reconciling with their family. One more thing. Both movies have a symbolic creature, a whale and a phoenix, respectively.
I am not going to dwell on the plot as it is adapted from a popular Disney animation with the same title. Not having seen the original animation, I am in no position to assess how closely the live-actors version adheres to the animated original.
Mulan strives on being thoughtful, measured, level-headed and sincere. It gently brings across its main agenda without crafty, manipulative emotions. For a mainstream entertainment, the action sequences are well choreographed, satisfying. LIU Yifei carries the lead capably, following the general direction of Caro is heading, sometimes to the extent of underacting, which I say as a compliment. Donnie YEN and Jet LI, while not exactly cameos, are there obviously to boost the box office take, with paint-by-number roles. Truly shining is GONG Li who, as the main villain, provides the best acting in portrayal of a character that has depth and layers.
There are tributes to other movies and TV series aplenty. The first appearance of Gong's character, emerging at a far distance from a sea of mists in a desert reminds you immediately of a similarly stunning scene in Lawrence of Arabia. When the phoenix's wings spread out from behind Mulan as if they are her own, you could almost see Danny with Dragon in the finale of Game of Thrones. The mysterious substance (for want of a better name) ""Chi"" must be a distant cousin of ""the force"" that is present in both the good (Jedi and Mulan) and the evil (Sith Lords and Gong's character).

Instead of writing in paragraph form, I'll just list them out numerically, in no particular order:1. Mulan possesses some other worldly super power that we are supposed to buy. I felt toyed with with this contrivance.2. The extras are poorly directed ~ they gander, gawk, look overly surprised, overact even in distant shots, and point their fingers at the subjects with baffling implausibility.3. The vivid colors are beautiful to look out, but seem to have a high degree of vibrance to hide the artificial backdrops and less than stellar CGI.4. Mulan looks far too feminine around the regiment, and the soldier love interest is way overplayed, as if he already knows her secret. He seems to be catering to her femininity. At one point he gets a good look at her upper backside while she swims in all its feminine curvature, and doesn't notice in the slightest.5. Mulan gets off the hook too easily when her deception is discovered. Seems too Disney friendly. Prior to the discovery, there's also a poor edited scene with her hair down and flowing in the midst of battle, and there's not a single shot of a reaction from a soldier to take notice of this.I did like the actress, who isn't a traditional beauty by any conventional standard. She carries the film well, and does not try to look too angry and tough in close up.

2020-09-15 00:00:00,"Despite this being the best disney adaptation its not free from easy solutions and lack of character development that could downgrade the development of the movie it self.
The story everyone knows, it's a girl who takes her father place and go to the war risking her life or her family honor.
At the beginning it's kinda confusing who is the main villain but as the story goes it seems more that ""the witch"" takes the primary role and the actually main villain from the animation takes a secondary role until the 30 or 15 last minutes.
Even in the animation the villains weren't that interesting, but at least they work very well when it was necessary to impose fear. But here the lack of personality is quite disturbing and it gets worse when u see the ""the witch"" swapping side just because Mulan like her speech. Dude really how superficial someone can be.
Now, I know we are talking about a disney movie, yet the decision of taking the dragon and the other guy,wich were actually what boost the animation with there sense of comedy, I think it could be compensated if they went through a darker and maybe bloody movie. There's a battle scene between the 2 armies and there's no drop of blood. Even the animation was darker. There's some decision that I didn't agree, like when mulan is in one place and over sunddently is in another. I think the picture would gain more if they show how difficult it actually was to do all of that.
Another thing that I think they could change was the Mulan story arc. Instead of making her badass just because she already was a badass and all it took was to reveal her truly Identity, they could make a longer arc where mulan doesn't have any special hability and she becomes a badass because she was able to go through all the difficulties.
Other things that bother me was the CGI that sometimes made me feel that I was watching a movie from a low cost company; the movie is too long for the story that propose to tell and the actions scenes are competent despite one or two of them being quite bad. Basically if u saw any good action movie you will feel that u already saw better scenes.

2020-09-15 00:00:00,"Mulan really has the potential to be a successful live action remake but they've blown it. I pirated this movie and I still want my $30 back. To summarize:
1. They turned Mulan from a relatable character with actual flaws and character development into a Mary Sue. The moral of the story changes from ""Through hard work and strong will, everyone can utilize their own strength to show that they are equally capable"" to ""Women can only be equal to men if they have some superpower"". They basically made a Chinese Elsa out of Mulan.
2. Unnecessary changes. They took out all the fun aspects of the movie: the songs, the side characters, and the pivotal moments--and changes it into something...less. All of the side characters are underutilized especially the witch who's there because of.....girl power? All of Mulan's soldier friends lack depth and I honestly only realized they're supposed to be Ling, Yao, and Chien Po after they spoke out the lyrics to A Girl Worth Fighting For (a cringe-worthy moment...either do it or don't).
3. Ugly acting and horrible editing. Liu Yifei has only what...3 expressions during the whole movie? She shed 1 (one) tear for her father, slightly annoyed face when knocked down by a fellow soldier, and the rest is a flat, boring face. It's like she's so afraid of looking ugly. And don't get me started on the editing. The jump cuts in many scenes are so jarring and disorienting that the audience really can't place themselves in the movie.
4. Culturally inaccurate. They say they take out Mushu to make this live action more ""realistic"" but they really didn't do much. What they do is romanticize as much orientalism as possible. Westernized view of Chinese values/legends and even then most of the details are messed up. What is that ugly makeup? That Southern China house for a Northern China legend? Wrong interpretation of Qi (not Chi)? Western phoenix? A witch??? Honestly I could go on.Seriously this movie is a trainwreck right from the very beginning until the end. They are trying SO hard yet they flop. I guess that's what you get when you don't involve any actual Chinese person in the filmmaking process, but still try to make this film to please the Chinese government...but not providing Chinese subtitles in your platform.

It tries to blend the old Chinese legend of Mulan with the animated film and it doesn't work. I would've liked if they only focused on one. Even if they just made a literal live-action movie of the animated one with little changes (like Beauty and the Beast, or Aladdin), at least it would feel like a complete story. I wish they focused more on the legend so it would at least feel different and new.Most of the behind the scenes crew are non-Asian people, specifically white and it sucks that that's the case. Yes, they have an all Asian cast but I don't feel a celebration like how Crazy Rich Asians felt. I just didn't feel for the characters too much, and the writing didn't help as well. I also feel that they were a lot of things cut from this movie. There are so many moments where a scene ends abruptly, and when they go to the next one, it feels like you're in the middle of it.I could go on but the rest makes more sense once you actually watch, which I DON'T recommend.

It starts off okay, but bearing question to Mulan's skills with no training, that parkour, really?The village is a closed off circle all living cramped up? Doesn't make sense to me when I see pictures of Chinese villages with beautiful landscapes.Where is Mulan's grandmother? With the cricket? That's hilarious, why take it away? It develops into the entire story of how Mulan brings dishonor to her family but instead we have a spider that jumps.Again, the soundtracks are iconic, they're funny, powerful. Disney is all about singing and the scenery and this director took that all away.Mulan cutting off her hair to blend in with the army, where is this? Because then she has the knot and all of the sudden later in the film she removes the knot and has beautiful LONG hair. I ain't a hair stylist but this is pretty stupid.Mushu? You took away Mushu to resemble ""realism"" but instead we have a Phoenix that is utterly useless, a witch that resembles the raven which is a pointless overpowered character, and huns that run on fortress walls with a vertical incline, no ropes, nothing, just like Spiderman would (I'm literally laughing out loud at this point), and --to you gamers-- no fall damage apparently. But hey, take away Mushu.Mulan's three pals on the animated movie are gone, which those roles brought so much life into Mulan.The dialogue is dull, it's a very lazy script.Mulan's captain and captain's father are gone as well, so we don't have that possible romance between the foot soldier and the captain going on.The entire plot prior to the battle and the avalanche makes no sense. Guys, hear me out, it makes NO SENSE; Forget about what everyone has mentioned that Mulan gives chase to the cavalry and they disappear but instead finds the witch which she's constantly talking to and a dagger knocks her out to realize she has to loosen up her hair in order to have her skills back, rides back to save everyone, jumps up 20 feet into the air kicking off spears, and suddenly sneaks around somehow without being spotted to flank from behind, pop some arrows to get their attention. (Good, we're all caught up); the catapults, they're awesome, the Imperial army hunkers down like a testudo formation and suddenly there are more testudos! But they're getting annihilated by the catapults whom have superb accuracy... but... all of the sudden they launch one at Mulan whenever she gets their attention and miss? Instead hit the snow on the mountainside creating the avalanche? Okay...The entire battle develops in a rather flat landscape, but when the avalanche is approaching, no one from the Imperial army has visual of the avalanche because they're below a ridge out of nowhere??? I thought they were on testudo formation with no cover but now they're beside a ridge. OKAY.Everyone is on testudo, nobody saw what Mulan did, she gets called out and that script still makes no sense to me whatsoever.The location of the Emperor's kidnapping makes no sense. The stage after the battle is about the huns getting to the emperor to kill him but hold him hostage for who knows how long. The raven and Mulan becoming bffs make no sense, just because they're women in a movie doesn't mean they have to get along...The phoenix, like I said, nonexistent.Loyal, Brave, True. This is Mulan's script that's the only thing that makes sense.I'm done.

2020-09-14 00:00:00,"Having seen most of the modern live-action remakes to Disney classics and having read some of the reviews for this one, I went into this movie with my expectations set on minimum. I really wanted to be surprised and enjoy it, to say the least. I don't hate all the previous remakes, I thought Beauty and The Beast was pretty good, and Aladdin and The Lion King just fine (although none of them come even close to the originals). Next in line comes Mulan, the newest Disney live-action re-imagining of an animated classic. Right from the first scene, this movie seems...sloppy, clumsy, unfinished. The visuals and cinematography were pretty good most of the time and that's pretty much everything good about it. Everything else from the script to the characters, to the acting is terrible. I don't know much about the original Chinese tale of Mulan, but since this is a remake of the animated movie, the story is butchered. I get the themes they were trying to touch upon, like a girl living in a ""man's world"", the value of family, finding your place and accepting yourself for who you really are. None of these is really achieved. Right from the start we learn that Mulan has powers and even from young age she can fight better than experienced fighters, this alone ruins the whole movie for me. You don't need to know how to fight in order to be a fighter, it's something the writers should know. The whole second act of the original movie is Mulan training in the camp disguised as a man and learning how to fight to honor her family and her country, she didn't come there already knowing kung-fu, sword fighting and having super powers. She needs to make sacrifices in order to get better and in this journey she makes friends and enemies. But now, knowing that she is already stronger than the whole Chinese army, how are we supposed to feel anything for her during this whole movie? There are literally zero stakes, she can beat anything and anyone, well except her evil counterpart witch Xian, probably the worst written character in this whole movie. At the beginning she is presented as the main villain (not the evil Khan), but in the final battle they try to make her a tragic character, a woman who made the mistake of being born on the wrong side. The fights are terrible, especially that big battle scene with zero logic and sense, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, corny, terribly acted and there for the sake of it. I can talk about this for the rest of the day but i'd rather not. All i can say is this movie is a corny mess with no real stakes, terrible screenplay, terrible casting (except Donnie Yen) and some really awful decisions story wise. Being a sloppy, heartless ride, I can honestly say that in my opinion this is the worst live-action Disney remake up to this point.",NEGATIVE,0.9935073256492616

2020-09-14 00:00:00,"""Do you believe they are actually picking a Chinese girl to play the role as Mulan in the new real-person Disney remake movie?""
I can still remember the question from an ABC girl and the excitement on her face when she was asking the question back in 2017. And after all these years of waiting, it turns out to be a complete disappointment.A 3-star is probably the best rating that I can give here.
Yifei Liu is absolutely the ideal cast for the character of Mulan. It looks astonishing on that reflection of Mulan in the sword poster. And that wins the movie one of the stars.
Some of the scenery in the movie are beautiful especially with IMAX 3D. Mountains and skyline of the capital city are breathtaking, which earns the second star. It is probably a half star if not with IMAX.
As for the third, since IMDB won't allow me to give a ZERO star for the worst movie of all time, it is basically a buy-2-and-get-1-for-free star.Mulan's story has been told to all the Chinese of their childhood for over a thousand years. And thanks for Disney, the story is told to all the world with their great cartoon movie in 1998. The spirit of Mulan has been encouraging generations of people, including her bravery, loyalty and most importantly her filial responsibility. (Well, that's true, Chinese people thinks highly of their filial duty.)
However, all the spirits above are but of words engraved on the sword, and the director really wants to tell that little story about a girl seeking for her true-self, which could be any other story but Mulan's. Despite of that, the whole story line is not logical, well, at all.
* Avoiding to face the true-self as a female? Is that true?
* Hiding family Kungfu from the troop? Is that necessary?
* Taking off all armor and helmet to run for a war fight? Cannot be more logical.
* A troop of well trained soldiers counting the Emperor's life on and only on a little girl? Best strategy ever.
* Such an easily provoked Emperor that would rather get himself into a one on one fight to a berserker? Trump wouldn't do that for sure.If you want to make a good Chinese history based movie, the least thing you have to do is to do some real study on it.
But all I can see from this movie is prejudice from westerners to Chinese traditional culture and a soulless Disney drama.
* Praying to phoenix for safety and peace? We don't ever do that in China.
* Concubines with pale white faces and bloody red cheek makeups? That's what Japanese Geishas do.
* A mind-controlling or transforming witch? Okay, Valar Morghulis.
* Phoenix Vs Eagle metaphor? What's that for?
Basically, not a single culture is presented precisely from where they come in this movie.
If you can read Chinese, you can learn more mistakes that are made about the culture, history timelines, etc, where the ratings goes all the way down to 4.9 after 3 days of the release.
If you can't, don't bother, and just remember the mistakes are much more than you can even imagine.
The director successfully made a contribution to alienate the understanding between the westerners and Chinese.
Westerners may think this another movie that is made for Chinese in order to please the Chinese market, while Chinese people are actually feeling INSULTED by all these cultural bias.
Niki Caro shows us a great example how to make a movie and offend both side of the audience.In the original Mulan folklore, there are no characters like Mushu, the cricket, and all the funny souls of ancestors. But who would possibly complain about a cute funny dragon especially when it comes from Disney? But when a silent, helpless and do-not-know-what-to-do phoenix is taking Mushu's place, it just let people doubt if this 2020 remake is actually a Disney movie.
Besides, Mulan is made a superhero with great talent when she was very young. And of course, a heroine cannot have a boyfriend, potential one, as a general or something. That adaption sounds not feminist at all.All in all, this movie is simply a waste of a good legend, passion from Disney fans, 2 hours of your life probably, and above all, 200 million dollars.

There where many parts that where changed form the original animated adaptation of the story, but a lot more culture as put in. I think it's easy to forget that the story is a Chinese tale first that was adapted by Disney into an animated format, and they harken back to that culture pretty well. Even down to the action scenes, that personally remind me of old Jackie Chan films and the writing which seem to pay homage to many Asian dramas. It is a bit different, and there are some changes that I'd make, but overall the movie was enjoyable and had a great message about honesty and just being confident in yourself without really focusing to much on a specific demographic, making it relate to a wider audience. The way they handled things such as her life in the camp and her desire to do the right thing despite what it could mean for her life was handled quite well in my opinion. Everything from how Mulan would have to wake up earlier and go to bed later to deal with her bindings, to her feelings of guilt for hiding her true identity. I believe that it was well casted as well. Sure we lost some fun side kicks and the main love interest was changed but what they have worked, at least for me. It was believable that these where real people, in a real war. (Cricket being one of the best characters.) However, the movie still has its flaws. Personally Xian Long (The Witch) turned to Mulan's side a little to easily, and I don't understand why she wasn't the main villain. I would have liked the poll scene to have been replaced with something more about wit than strength. I fill that the whole point of the poll challenge was to teach how to turn a disadvantage in to an advantage. Using your head to tern something restrictive into an asset. In this version it was replaced with climbing a mountain with buckets of water. I suppose it could have been a mind over mater thing, however it came off as more of a ""I just got stronger, I guess,"" kind of vibe, rather than being a problem that you had to out think.

I really mean, nothing. The CGI looks questionable at times, the phoenix was confusing and useless but its most disappointing qualities are that of its changes to the characters and the plotline. For instance, the decision made to make Mulan a prodigy invalidates just about what made her stick as a character in my mind. She was proof that it was possible to become good at something so as long as you persevered. In the 1998 film, Mulan is offered a role as an advisor but in the 2020 film she gets an offer to be a guard. In the age of Disney trying to be relevant and/or woke, this comes off as insulting. There's really no good that comes out of preformative feminism which doesn't work to benefit all women. Instead it pits women against other women. Even the 2020 Mulan was at times innovative and in return, you give her a job that allows for her to not input any of her useful insight? How is that fair and why did Disney think it worked from a story perspective. What made the 1998 Mulan tick was that it explored the extreme ends of preforming masculinity (she was super awkward when she first met Li Shang) and femininity (I mean the matchmaker scenes were just perfect) and she failed at both. Instead she demonstrated that it's important to harness the qualities of both genders and that she only succeeded when she used both.Finally, I'm going to dock points a point for historical accuracy because while this was never marketed as some sort of historical epic and it's a Disney film, the thing with costuming, art direction and set design, is that it has to add to the story. I mean Moulin Rouge's costumes aren't really historically appropriate but they add to the feeling of what a spectacle Moulin Rouge is. For example, one could look to the type of house that Mulan's family lived in. As the story is set in Central China, the round houses were characteristic of those in the southwestern part of the country. I'm sure the shape of the houses aren't really relevant to the plot but it wouldn't hurt to change that aspect especially if you're not constricted by the confines of animation. To be frank, I find it insulting that Disney has all the money and couldn't hire a single (or better, several) East Asian Studies/literature professor to help them with that?I can't speak to how accurate the script was as I'm not terribly knowledgable about the original ballad and as such, I can't dock a whole lot of points for that. Perhaps it wasn't the worst film I've ever seen due to technicalities, but it it earned itself a one-star rating for its lack of innovation given its resources.",NEGATIVE,0.9903644919395448

This is how Mulan 2020 makes me feel; every frame has something wrong in it. What were the writers thinking when they make this up? This film's setting resembles nothing like China historically. And man they screwed up the dialogue. Half of the top billed cast can't even speak fluent English, the accents they have make no sense, particularly Mulan's little sister Xiu , who has a British accent (though she tried to disguise it with American but it just doesn't work). The setting and acting don't look real in general. And they took out Mushu, a character which I actually liked in the original.The Wuxia reference is weird, why introduce these elements when you have no intention of expanding it, not even a bit? And blending magic into the plot just makes the whole thing more confusing.Why Disney tries a serious tone in the storytelling is beyond me. The scene where Rouran army attacking the garrison is ridiculous, the anti-physics jump (That was cool 30 years ago), no blood shed, not even bruises, and you're telling me this is an army attack. The original did a much better job. The sudden cues of family-friendly really sickens me. Again, why try to be serious when you can't?",NEGATIVE,0.9993407726287842

We hired her for my sisters birthday and have been friends since. I am SO proud of my friend for her beautiful song 'loyal brave and true' which Christina also does justice.The movie itself, I don't know where to begin what a hot mess it was. The original film had at least humor and romance in addition to the action. This was straight action. The original was made for everyone. This film felt made for boys. I was bored out of my skull the Whole time. There wasn't even a conflict to add, like in the original when she pretends to be a man. She blows that cover almost immediately,

2020-09-13 00:00:00,"I didn't expect a copy of the animated film, I think it would be interesting if they took a different path to tell the story in a realistic way. The idea of removing Mushu, the ancestors, the cricket and the musical scenes was good, because it worked perfectly on an animated film but in a live action it wouldn't... but then they contradicted themselves by inserting some fantasy elements that just felt ridiculous. You can't connect with the story.I could point so many things that went terribly wrong, but I'll just mention two:1. They spent $200,000,000 on this film. $200,000,000! I recognize some elements of production design, photography and costume design were good. But come on, why did they made the combat scene at the snow mountain so lame? They had a $200,000,000 budget! I wonder where did they spend all that money because I don't really see it in the movie.2. The forced feminism. They want to show they care about this social issue but I don't understand why this vain effort in doing so. (I don't consider myself a feminist nor against feminism.)The original Mulan was already feminist. It showed how being a woman didn't stop Mulan from saving his family and, by consequence, her country. She was an ordinary woman that wanted to honor her family by following their traditions and getting married as they wanted, but when they ask his father to join the army she knows he is too old for that and is surely going to die on war. So she, for no other reason but love for her family and a wish to honor them despite failing in being a good woman, decides to sacrifice herself and go to war instead of her father. We see how she commits in being a good soldier, fails many times and yet she doesn't give up until she succeeds. They discover she is a woman because in the combat scene at the snow mountain she gets hurt while risking her life to save everyone and when they cure her they discover the truth. Even after they reject her, she insist and follows them to protect the emperor, they follow her because she becomes a leader and wether they accept her or not, she is still going to risk her life doing everything she can to save the emperor. She knows her limitations, she is not strong and because of that she uses her intelligence instead.
In this film the message is clear: It doesn't matter who you are, you can achieve anything if you trust yourself and work very hard for it.But on this new film, well... she is special, she has the power of ""Chi"". She doesn't even bother in being better. Why would she? She is so powerful and special just because the script says so. There is no development. She never does anything to win her comrades trust and respect. She reveals herself being a woman because she has to stop hiding who she really is, she must show the whole world how special she is. They reject her, but next scene she is back and suddenly everyone are all like ""Oh Mulan, you are the one that must protect the emperor because we just realized how special you are."" ""I am captain of this army and have years of experience but it doesn't matter, I trust your Chi, so please, lead us and save the emperor, you are our only hope."" This is just lame and extremely forced.
In this film the message is also clear: You can do anything but only if you are ""special"", otherwise don't even bother trying.",NEGATIVE,0.994037389755249

2020-09-13 00:00:00,"I see that many reviews are berating this film for not following the animation more, but instead of hoping for a frame-by-frame reshoot like The Lion King, I would say have an open mind going into this. After all, I doubt the original Chinese legend had Eddie Murphy in mind to play a role. I haven't seen the 1998 animation, so I cannot draw comparison.The film starts a little slow, but bare with it, after about half an hour it kicks in. It's refreshing to see a cast purely of the ethnicity intended for the story, rather than having one Westerner to play a key role to the plot. Scenery is impressive and worth a mention for the visual appreciation it can cause. There are cheesy moment in there for sure, and some of the acrobatics can be on the borderline too. Having not grown up with this type of cinema apparent in my culture, it can be easy to scoff at some of the 'stunts', flipping up everything possible and frequently running up walls, and to be fair, at times the way these are shot are a little cringe-worthy. However, this is a way of bringing Eastern and Western cinema together, incorporating important elements of each type of film.You may not like this film because there is no dragon, it isn't a musical, and a witch has been added (somewhat unnecessarily), but you have to appreciate that this is ultimately a Disney film. This is for children to enjoy. Personally, I very much appreciate how a different culture is given the limelight, with a cast (mostly) unknown outside of Eastern cinema.

2020-09-13 00:00:00,"Mulan is a beautifully shot story, where overcoming own weakness and adapting to known order was replaced with inner power. New Mulan is a great warrior from the beginning and thus this move her character (and plot) loses it's power and greatness. You can clearly see this in final battle - where Han doesn't stand a match to Mulan and writers create very stupid solution to force viewers that Mulan MUST uses her Wit to overcome Han and achieve victory.Despite losing plot and origin of story showed in animation years ago, this new creation has its own strength - it is beautiful show, with great fight sequences, superb acting and camera work, along with great music and epic battles. It's darker than animation. And it has Witch - which is at one side great character, and leading all existing events to render them pointless. But, Witch itself is extraordinary character - well played, greatly exposed and way to powerful!It could be piece of art - an extraordinary achievement, but writers overcomplicated it, made one but very important change to the origin and busted it.Compared to original Mulan I would give it 2/10

2020-09-13 00:00:00,"Let's start with the pros: the set design and art team did well to capture the feel from the original.Now that we got that out of the way, let's jump into what a mess that movie was.1) PLOT HOLES: When the witch possessed the soldier and approached the emperor, she could have just killed the emperor and taken power. No war needed, the witch can have her throne and Khan can just reign along side. You might argue that Khan wanted to kill emperor himself but the witch could just magically take Khan inside the palace. What's the point of the war?
2) The Witch: What was the point of this character? To drive home the point of feminism? To create a female antagonist? If these were the aim of the witch character, sadly it failed. Her dialogue were so pointless that I wasn't even listening when she was talking. How she had that epiphany after one chat with Mulan and then sacrificed herself to save her was so baffling and rushed. Character development doesn't happen after one discussion, they aren't light switches.
3) Chi: Mulan in the original cartoon trained hard after everyone went to bed. She worked at her fighting and combat skills. That was inspirational, it made Mulan a role model who worked hard and did not use her looks to get by. This live action got rid of this aspect completely. Instead it gave her and the witch 'chi' without a faint explanation why or how this chi came about. What is the deal with this??? I'm all for magical worlds but present this to viewers with well thought out backstory. Don't throw magic in just for the sake of it.
4) The phoenix: if we removed the phoenix from the movie would it have made a difference to the overall outcome?
5) Travel: Is it Mulan's chi to travel fast and become invisible? If it was then that would explain how she got past a large army of enemies without being seen and shoot at them from behind. As well how she can travel through the entire city to protect the emperor
6) Dialogue: many times the characters seem to tell us what is happening instead of just letting the audience figure things out. Example: when the witch first appeared to Mulan, she says ""Oh it's a witch."" Writers seem to not understand the point of dialogue.
7) Armor: Inconsistency with the armors, it seemed like arrows pierces the armors with no issues (horse back chase scene). Mulan's armor seemed useless against the witch's mini dagger but her fabric wrap around her chest saved her. Ummmmmm even if you argue she uses bamboo or other material to wrap her chest, would it still stronger than the metal armor?Had so much hope for this movie as I loved the animation original. This live action tried but sadly did not meet expectation.",NEGATIVE,0.9967969059944152
2020-09-13 00:00:00,"As one who loved the animated version of Mulan, I can fully say that this is not a remake as many other recent Disney live actions have been... which is a good thing!To those that are unaware, Mulan is an actual Chinese legend. To make this solely a remake of the animated classic, and not its own take would be a dishonour on the legend, a dishonour to the Chinese, and a dishonour to your cow (see what I did there). They are of course similar in many ways, and there are nods to the animated film, such as subtle music queues which are appreciated, but to be clear this is very much its own movie.The scenery and sets are visually captivating. The colours are vibrant with both the costumes and the set pieces. The acting has its flaws, but the passion from the actors is real, and it feels like everyone bought in to their roles. Mulan's father is a strong point as he convincingly displays a wide range of emotions.I enjoyed this film. It has its corny moments, but keep in mind this is a Disney family film, so it's to be expected.

2020-09-13 00:00:00,"I don't usually write reviews, but the avalanche of negative reviews which don't seem to understand nor appreciate the rationale of this remake prompts me to write one to address them.Firstly, this is a REMAKE, and I think those who go in expecting an exact replica of their dream cartoon has already started off on a wrong footing. As one reviewer puts it, the perfect Mushu has already been enshrined in the original cartoon - so why get upset when this reinterpreted the story without him?The purpose of remakes is usually to re-tell the story in a fresh, new way. Some remakes try to stay as faithful to the original plot as possible. Some veer off-course a little. This movie belongs to the latter, and while the necessity of some changes raise eyebrows, I think they have succeeded on certain accounts:1. Portraying the beauty of traditional Chinese values: if you appreciate this as a story set in very traditional and historic Chinese culture, you can see how this remake has made a beautiful attempt to capture the essence of deep values very important to traditional Chinese. Courage, loyalty, and truth - each are retold vividly through Mulan's (and her family's) story and struggle. Her inner struggle to stay True is particularly touching and real.Family ties and filial piety are also very strong values of the Chinese culture. The addition of a sister character is perhaps not as needless as many think, for Mulan's close relations with her sister substantiates the importance of her family to her. The wrapping up of the story with an additional virtue - piety - to Mulan's sword, also speaks volumes of this theme in the movie. 'Chi' is a very core element of Chinese Buddhism, and its addition shows a storyteller very in tune and faithful to highlight traditional Chinese culture. As is the the phoenix, an animal with as much significance as the dragon Chinese (a Mushu equivalent then?).2. Underlying moral themes: I have to admit the addition of the witch is a contentious topic that I have mixed feelings about. But if you see past the cliche magic and pay attention to the moral meaning this character brings out, that sheds light. Circumstances do not give you a right to act badly, and humans have a choice of how they act. The parallel circumstances between Mulan and the witch teaches the lesson of taking responsibility over our own actions - an important lesson especially in an age where so many are prone to react and blame circumstances around them, without considering how they themselves have a part to play and how they should account for their own actions.I have more to add, but I think these suffice to make the point that if one gets past expecting the same movie in form, one will find many treasures within this - not least a chance to appreciate deeply Chinese culture and values, beautiful stunts, and cinematography.",POSITIVE,0.9967839121818542
2020-09-13 00:00:00,"I think the movie is quite good. Aside from any political controversy this movie had, this version brings a different portrayal of Mulan. In this story, Mulan portrayed as a ready-made superhuman warrior with Chi. This is the opposite of the classic Mulan where the character even though got talent and potential, still, needs hard work to gain the achievement.The story itself focused on the fourth virtues: Courage, true to yourself, loyal, and devotion to the family. I understand why fans enrage and unsatisfied by this movie because I admit they make huge changes from the classic one. These changes include:a. They substitute Mushu with not-so-useful Phoenix (who, literally do nothing in the movie and just occasionally appear)
b. Add new characters like The Witch. I think Disney added this character to emphasize the message ""true to yourself"" but fail to impress the audience. I kind of like this character, but her development throughout the movie feels forced and half-baked which make people think her appearance in the movie is unnecessary. Also, how she ends up, really really predictable.
c. LESS ROMANCE, as a big fan of romance, quite disappoints me. They change Shang with Honghui, there are scenes indicating romance but not much, and the story never focuses on itLast but not least, the thing that bothers me maybe the fighting scenes. Illogical and forced. I will give you two examples of this.
a. When Mulan and some troops chased Bori Khan troops, all the Mulan's troops got shot by an arrow and fall from the horse (the remaining two just run). Only Mulan able to dodge the arrows (how silly because even though they want to highlight Mulan's skill, they make Mulan's troops look really lame compared to Bori Khan troops where some of them had the ability to dodge arrows)
b. Mulan appears unrealistically beautiful and clean even in the midst of war (She didn't cut her hair like in the classic, not even tie it). She also seemed not bothered by her long hair which several times cover her eyes. How the hell someone like that even survive and able to fight in a war.Overall, this movie is still entertaining in its own way as long as you can ignore the differences from the classic one.SIDE NOTES: I still prefer Donnie Yen and Jet Li play for action/kung fu movies. I feel so strange saw Jet Li act as an emperor, somehow warrior or Kung Fu master suits him better (in my eyes). The same feeling for Donnie Yen, he felt so rigid in the movie. I think this movie kinds of wasted two great martial artists.",NEGATIVE,0.991659939289093

Why I said this is that the movie experience was somewhat close to watching at a regular theatre. Unfortunately not even my kids enjoy this movie. At least I was expecting some decent fights which was not there. Jet li was just for name sake. There wasn't much role for donny Yen also. I did not feel it unbearable, but there was no grace or charm. From Disney movies I generally expect more, at least for my kids.",NEGATIVE,0.9981384873390198
2020-09-13 00:00:00,"I was expecting this movie since it was announced.
What a great casting, Yifei Liu was the perfect lead choice, Donnie Yen and Jet Li at the position they deserved, Gong Li at a character apparently written for her.Nice cinematography with natural and production designed rooms, fantastic landscapes, immense Chinatowns that you cannot tell if they are real or CGI.Main script LOYAL to the original anime version, BRAVE changes of characters omitting boring Mushu and songs and inclusion of Gong Li's witch, TRUE as far as a westerner can tell to the Chinese culture.A light touch of Disney in the somewhat flamboyant color choices and in the absence of any drop of blood despite numerous killings.Better than the anime and better than the Chinese version made about a decade earlier which was only for adults.Now if you are a Chinese nationalist who doesn't like Chinese speaking English or American companies earning from Chinese folklore; or a political issues fanatic judging a movie from activists' targetted locations of shooting 1min of the movie, you might certainly get annoyed by minor things (some people rated 1 because the Phoenix was not talking); but if you are a non-Chinophobian normal person, you will certainly like it.",POSITIVE,0.9988468885421752

Looking like everyone is just joining the ""hate mulan"" bandwagon. Why is it that when there is a movie about a strong woman ppl always want to hate on it? Smells like sexism to me.

2020-09-13 00:00:00,"Well, with this 2020 live action movie version of the classic ""Mulan"" tale, I must admit that my expectations were set up rather high. Especially so since I do like the tale and were looking forward to seeing what director Niki Caro could muster with this project.And now that I have seen ""Mulan"" I can say that I was entertained, sure. But this movie was by no means the grand movie that I had hoped for. Now, don't get me wrong here, because the movie is enjoyable and watchable, but it was just lacking something to make it pop out and be unique and outstanding. Especially when you hold ""Mulan"" up against the endless number of similar movies of Chinese epics that are made in China and Hong Kong.What the 2020 ""Mulan"" had working for it was first and foremost the familiarity of the storyline and plot. But also the cast ensemble, that really impressed me. I mean, ""Mulan"" has the likes of Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Li Gong, Jet Li, Jason Scott Lee, Rosalind Chao, Tzi Ma and Xana Tang on the cast list, just to mention the most familiar of performers. And yeah, I was thrilled that they gave Yifei Liu the role of Mulan, because she is a great actress and have some really impressive martial arts epics to her resumé, and she carried the Mulan role quite well. I have to admit that it was nice to see Jet Li on the screen again. One performance that really blew me away was Jason Scott Lee as the villain, wow. His performance as this characters was phenomenal.And one cannot watch ""Mulan"" without taking in all the breathtaking scenery and sets. From the majestic landscapes to the small villages, it was just spectacular to look at. And it was so obvious that the props people had definitely worked well at their tasks, because there were so many nice details and things to observe. And also the costumes and props should be commended here, because they definitely also worked wonderfully.Visually, then I have to say that ""Mulan"" is spectacular to look at. Not only the landscapes and sets, but also the cinematography as a whole. The way the action sequences and martial arts sequences are filmed and presented to the audience, where you can feel the action and how dynamic it all is. At times it felt like you were right there in the frame with the cast.Something that I had problems coping with in the 2020 version of ""Mulan"" was the fact that everyone spoke English. It just took away so much authenticity from the movie. Sure, this was a Disney project, but come on. You can't set a movie in an ancient Chinese dynasty and have everyone speak English. It was just such a stupid thing, and it was cringeworthy that the writers had opted for this. If they had spoken Mandarin, as they were supposed to, the movie would have been all the more enjoyable.Now, one can argue for or against the lack of Mushu in the movie. You know, the quirky dragon from the animated movie, voiced by Eddie Murphy. Sure, I was missing it in the movie, but I think it was a good thing that the writers didn't include Mushu, because it would have been a distracting element that would have taken away focus from the movie as being a serious movie. I believe if they had added Mushu to the live action movie here, it would have dragged down the movie. It pains me to say, because Mushu is the most enjoyable character in the animated movie, and I love the character quite a bit. However, they added a phoenix instead, but it doesn't really interact with Mulan or speak to her, but it worked well, because it was a representation of her ancestry, and it was just beautiful to look at.All in all, ""Mulan"" is an entertaining movie for sure, and I would have rated it a seven star rating if they had not opted to go for the English language being spoken. I enjoyed ""Mulan"" and it is definitely a good movie. My rating, however, lands on a six out of ten stars, because of the language issue.",POSITIVE,0.9990530610084534
2020-09-13 00:00:00,"I struggle to find something nice to say about this movie. It was an unenriching experience to say the least, and managed to make a huge country like China feel like a small place. The actors didn't show much emotion, and the characters seemed to make decisions or change their minds on a whim. The creature effects seemed fake, and even the action was awkward and didn't make much sense. The movie introduces a new important character but they have a dissapointingly predictable path.

Once I accepted that this film wasn't going to be the animated film at all, I started to enjoy it. The usual, acting was good, cinematographry, so on and so on.My only two complaints. First, There was some pretty bad editing in the film and some camera 'fancy' camera work that I don't think was necessary.And second, basically giving her super human abilities to explain her fighting ability was pretty trash in my opinion. It just got rid of the concept that she could have achieved the greatness the eventually does through her persistence and hard work, something the animated film did wonderfully.How I would recommend this movie: 'if you go into it with a clear mind, and not judging it based on the animated film, I think you will enjoy it and have a good time.

---------------------For me, it was ok, sceneries are lovely, the look is definitely beautiful and I can see they tried to follow the original poem more than the animated version. I don't have a problem that it isn't like the animated version, in fact I welcome the more serious tone, and tried to be a standalone movie. Losing Mushu isn't a problem for me, because historic Mulan has no Mushu anyway and I feel this was an attempt to be an epic. There are good things and bad things about this movie and I will try to be fair.To be honest, the beginning of the movie already felt wrong as you come into the introduction scene of Mulan's village, which is a bunch of round houses. People from outside Chinese culture wouldn't spot the problem, but as someone who knows China, a historic land that has over 200 dialects and over 50 minorities culture, we instantly knew this isn't a typical Han Chinese dwellings, in fact it is a typical Hakka building which isn't started to be built until 12th century, and the original poem about Mulan is based from an era between 4th - 6th century AD. We can safely assume the ""historic"" Mulan come from the Northern part of China definitely not a Hakka who originated in the central part of China.Now some might say it isn't a huge problem as this doesn't affect enjoying a film... yes, to the average white person it doesn't. But it disrespects the varieties of cultures and minorities cultures that makes up China as a whole. Imagine as a Chinese person if I made a film about the English Queen Elizabeth I, and put her palace in the middle of Italy...It's beautiful, right? Surely if it looks good, it should be ok? No of course not. It looks good, but it isn't an authentic representation, so it is going to take people out of it because it doesn't feel ""real"" anymore. I compare to the seriousness of The Last Samurai when they were bothered enough to build a Japanese village from scratch, its attention to details and accuracy was so excellent that the Japanese extra was so shocked with joy and it tears up their eyes! Surely Disney can afford this type of authenticity but chose not to?Before I get into the plots, there's this biggest disappointment I have was that it's such a big waste for Gong Li's and Donnie Yen's character.Donnie Yen's character is supposedly a well respected war time hero/general, who embodies the model hero figure from the Chinese culture as someone who is fair, experienced, wise and firm. But with little proof and work from Mulan after her setting off the avalanche to deplete the enemies, which, he didn't even know it was her handy work, he just went and ask her to lead the army into the Imperial City because a handful of her comrades begged him to listen to her was such a flimsy plot for me.I mean, as the experienced General, surely he knows the way into the Imperial City? What about his honour? They need a better plot than this gleefully general handing the rest of the army to rookie Mulan for no good reason. In truth, the moment of gaining the General's respect is important in the story and it should be crafted better, because it shouldn't feel like so easily to obtain! Honour and trust has to be earned!Also, Donnie Yen hasn't got much action scene in this film either, which totally wasted the talent he has, and failed an opportunity to showcase what a tough war it was. Subsequently, this also rendered the whole Chinese army a bunch of wussy. In that sense, the animated version Mulan did a better job here than the real live action. And for somehow Mulan is the only one who has this special ""chi"" amongst thousands others soldiers is pretty unrealistic, which also brings me to another shock - when is ""chi"" being treated like a special power?""Chi"" can be strong or weak, ""chi"" flows in everyone's body (a literal translate means ""air"", but not literally air that you breathe). You can strengthen your chi by rigorous training. Most importantly, having a strong chi doesn't equate prowess.The mastery of martial art is a skill which requires technique, experience, and chi only plays a part. With only having a strong chi doesn't make you a kung fu master. That's why Chi Kung (the art of chi), is used for strengthening your body and health and is not a typically combat kung fu style. However, many martial artists also practice Chi Kung to strengthen their body, (the flow of chi), to maximise their endurance in combat. (And some say it helps you to heal faster or rejecting toxic out of your body).What this live-action rendition failed to illustrate is the real moral of the story about Mulan, they made everything so easily gained for her to achieve. I wanted to feel like I'm really rooting for her and be at the edge of my seat!The legendary Mulan that we (Chinese) all know so well, to us, it's always been about her determination, endurance, her bravery to be more than what she is being expected, and do the right thing with a courageous attitude without betraying the loyalty is what made her such a respectable figure for young girls to look upon to. The key point is making all those difficult decision and go through with it with bravery. The way they have used ""chi"" in the film as a way to illustrate Mulan is somehow born special, has regrettably chipped away that important backbone moral of this story and taking the attention away the most admirable qualities about Mulan.For Gong Li's character, what an awful shallow character! It has little to no depth to it. You don't feel you care about her, or emotionally invested in her at all. It's pretty obvious her character's existence is simply an excuse to use special effect, since she's a shape-shifter witch (tho I really can't recall Chinese folklores have witches. Traditionally, more like in the form of mystic masters, let alone a shape-shifting witch). And yet, as a powerful shape shifter, she cannot take the form of Khan and lead his army, or has to die so pointlessly when she can just wave her hand to deflect an arrow away from Mulan? Or just impersonated the Emperor and rule the kingdom instead?I mean, honestly, if you have power, why do you need to be cowered down to someone who is ordinary? The film needed to explain why a little bit more. Even if it's because Khan has an army, and she doesn't, the power dynamic should be more of a collaboration, than being ""enslaved"" by Khan. Because obviously, Khan has no power over Gong Li's character at all.And Mulan? Overall her character is ok, but it could have been even better if they investigate more into her feelings. On that point, I can't help but feel the actress has been very wooden-face, almost the same face in every scene, even when she is fighting or sad. It's consistently the same ""looking far away"" look in the eyes, and face is so unmoved that you almost thought she feels nothing at all.Overall, it's a ""certified-whitewashed"" and watered down story about a much loved Chinese legend. Remember the poem we have about Mulan, is about over 1500 years ago. The war she went to lasted for 10 years, and it took her another 2 years to travel back home. The film doesn't even give any hint about the emotional turmoil Mulan must face and the toughness of the war. I understand it is a film for kids, but even with that in mind, there's so much room that they can improve if Disney bothered to hire some Chinese writers who understands the backbone moral of the story and its culture in the writing room. In this case, the animated version did better as they had one Chinese writer on board.And the ""Loyal, Brave and True"" slogan? oh boy, I understand this is effective for children, to represent what Mulan is, or her cultural significance. But the way they play around it is somewhat chessy. It reminds me of all the Chinese words people tattooed on themselves in the 90s, purely because people think they look cool, but made no effort to understand the depth of its culture, which is what I can sum up about the film.",NEGATIVE,0.8554686307907104

However:1. I found it incredibly boring. Notably - I didn't feel any connection to the characters, or relate to their feelings / motivations.2. It's not really clear what genre this movie is trying to be. Does it want to be serious, or funny? Because the jokes fell flat.3. I feel that the fantasy element that they were going for didn't really fit. There was no real context provided as to whether these characters are human or not. But for some reason, people could fight Matrix style; and some characters could shapeshift. It kinda felt like the writers randomly meshed together ideas from different movies, and I'm not sure that it worked.One final thing to mention - I ended up watching the cartoon version immediately after.

Mulan inspires people to be better and show that everything is possible as long as you work for it. However, this ""Mulan"" has no character development whatsoever, she starts stronger than the other characters and everything she accomplishes looks effortless.
You love Disney magic? Great! In here you have no gravity, witchcraft, Lord of the Rings Legola's double-arrow, packed with non plausible physics. Who needs bows when you can shoot arrows with your feet? Who needs ladders when you can just run up the walls?
I already knew that some characters wouldn't make it to the movie but making Mushu a Phoenix and turning Mulan's Grandmother into a sister, that added nothing to the storyline, did not change the movie for the better. The characters that remained were bland and boring, including Mulan herself.

I was expecting the same feeling of feminism and women's empowerment as I felt when I watched the original animated version. However, I was sorely disappointed. I wanted to get up and leave in the first 10 minutes itself and I would have, had I not come with friends.
It was devoid of a lot of the main characters that stood out for me in the original movie. They left out all the catchy meaningful songs. In addition, some of the scenes were so cliche that they left me feeling very uncomfortable. The whole movie seemed to have a very serious tone, unlike the animated one.
The movie lacks the depth and symbolism that the animated movie had, which made the original Mulan one of my favourite movies of all time. I do not think that the people who made this movie really understood why the original story was so meaningful to a lot of people.
There are a few nice things though about this movie. I did like the presence of the emperor and Böri Khan, the fearsome warrior, and I absolutely adored the scenery.
Since it was called ""Mulan"", I expected it to resemble to original movie in more ways and, because of this, I was disappointed. Had the movie not been named ""Mulan"", I might not have watched it.

Special effects - horrible, not good at all, it looked like old chinese movies.3. Feminism - I get the subtle massage in the movies, when alongside a good script and great story they put in some inspirational thought, however this one was not executed well at all. When you have a strong well established female protagonist in the story, maybe don't force another female antagonist with the lamest story of all and the lamest ending.

When the movie finished I can only give it 4!!! The only good thing is the fighting scene. And the rest of the scenes is like only a few takes then director said, ok, that'll do! With no tension at all! Totally not serious at all with each scene. Because there is lack of character development in the first half of the film and she didn't gone thru much at all in the first half of the film, so there wasn't any tension builded up and so once she decided to show her true self, which supposed to make you feel excited and emotional , make you feel empty instead.

I was happily surprised that she sung Reflection in Mandarin version (it's on the ending credits) her voice is so beautifully soothing and soft.

Anyway, for the movie itself, it wasn't like the animated Mulan 1998. I know people disappointed because there was no Mushu, but in Mulan's story, it was originally based on a legendary warrior from 2000 BCE China and I think Disney's trying to make it more to a realistic movie. This version of Mulan is closer to the actual story than the cartoon animated. It's actually a good movie and deserves watching even though they made some changes like replacing Shang with Honghui and taking out Mushu and replaced it with Phoenix (and in Chinese folklore, the phoenix represents woman so that's a good match).

The best and most interesting character was the witch. If they had made a movie about her it could be really good.2. The fight scenes are looking fine but I never believed them or took away in the movie land. I know that none of them are realistic, but if I saw Ip Man I was fascinated but the fast pace and perfect movement of Donnie Yen but the Mulan actress couldn't bring me to this point. Furthermore, the scene with the Trebuchet was actual braking the last bit of immersion in little bit pieces. Yes, it's a devastating weapon but slow and not really accurate. In this movie this damn thing hitting its targets accurate and fast like a modern tank with a laser guidance system.3. You, can recognize the green screen scenes. They looks artificial and so the remaining pieces of any kind of immersion are vaporized and vanishing in the fating nebular.4. End titles.

2020-09-12 00:00:00,"I ignored all the reviews before watching because I wanted to come to my own conclusion of the film. I went into it with the knowledge that Disney took a different approach to the story and didn't just make an exact live action version of the animated version. I came to this film as open minded as can be and still I'm disappointed. Sure I was upset that Mushu and the songs had been cut out, but I forgave that when they said they wanted be more loyal to the original legend. Still, this film failed to deliver.I cannot stand the addition of the ""witch"" character. I did my research to see if there's a witch in the original legend and no there isn't. In fact there are no supernatural elements in the original legend and this is a legend that came about in late 300s-500s A.D ! Disney wanted to play the ""loyal"" to the original source game, then why on earth did they get rid of the lovable supernatural elements like the ancestors, Mushu, and the cricket and trade them for this annoying addition of a witch ? This made no sense.In the animated version, the villain has a hawk sidekick. This movie gave that hawk a bigger role by having it be a witch. Like in Maleficent with the raven character from Sleeping Beauty being a shape shifter or something in the live action adaptation. The animated Mulan was much more realistic with the battle scenes even with Mushu and the cricket involved, the live action turned the battle scenes into fantastical nonsense by including this witch in the film. She talks to Mulan and Mulan eventually sympathizes with her, but it's just ridiculous. That was my main biggest pet peeve with this disastrous film.The songs were removed but you can hear their melodies in the background for some scenes. Yet they pulled a live action ""Lion King"" and have the characters talk the lyrics to the songs we all know and love. What in the world were they thinking ? Did they think people enjoyed the voice actor of Scar in the live action ""Lion King"" talking his way through ""Be Prepared ?"" All this did was show me how much I prefer the original animated version and in the middle of the film, I'm already thinking about rewatching the animated one.The fighting scenes are just cheesy. Disney makes this film to be more respectful to the Chinese community and they give them a film with comical kung-fu scenes. I mean I have no idea what was going through their heads when they made this? Even crazier that Disney was so confident with this one, with the way they acted with the release of this, they probably thought this was gonna be a big Oscar contender. If anything, maybe for the costumes, but in terms of direction, story, and acting - yeah right.This was a huge heads-up (as if a lot of the previous ones weren't already) that Disney needs to stop with the live action remakes. This was yet another soulless, shameless cash grab. They wanted to make it up to China since there was controversy with the animated version back in the late 90's, but I don't see how this embarrassment fixed anything. Disney, you want to know why China responded positively to Dreamworks Kung Fu Panda ? Apart from the animation of that time, they loved the idea that they respectfully used their culture to tell a fun, heartwarming story. Sadly that's clearly where Disney is lacking nowadays, storytelling, that's why they keep releasing unnecessary live action remakes every year.Do yourself a favor and skip this. Save the extra $30 if you're already a Disney Plus subscriber and just rewatch the 90's classic. 2 stars is generous, but the makeup and costume department deserve a positive shout out.",NEGATIVE,0.9989675879478456

I don't compare this to the animated version as some do. I judge it by its own merit. The acting was good, the sets incredible. (It does seem a shame we can no longer tell what is real and what is computerized. That makes movies ""less amazing"" in general.) The choreography was acceptable, though many Asian martial arts films blow Mulan out of the water in that aspect. The music wasn't impressive; typical Disney fare that didn't match the Mulan setting at all.So get ready for an action movie that really isn't that impressive. The story falls fall short of hopes, the plot is rather pedestrian, with nothing to put this above a ""basic flick"" 5-stars.Don't be shocked: Mulan is a woman, not a man.

2020-09-11 00:00:00,"The most correct decision made by the authors of the new reading of the poem about Hua Mulan is an attempt to abstract from the original 1998 cartoon. While the modern version of Mulan still adheres to Walt Disney's framework for how directors and screenwriters need to work with familiar stories of classic animation, the film still has an ambition to be a project in its own right.
In general, if we talk about the cast of the film, it's quite excellent.
But despite such a successful casting decision, Mulan's story cannot be believed. The script of the film is a uniform mess, rushing at full speed into unknown direction. It feels like the authors were in a hurry to show everything to their viewer as soon as possible, fearing to miss his attention even for a second. But if the viewer really had something to miss, there would be no questions. The truth is no need to watch this film in order to know what and how it works.
Yes, the studio didn't need to invent a new Chinese poem. But the film clearly had the ambition to be something epic on a grand scale in the best traditions of Akira Kurosawa, the master of samurai epics.
Let's look at the situation from the point of view of movie makers. We have a certain trend in Hollywood cinema that has been popular in recent years and we want to adjust the good old story familiar to the audience for it. Let's transform a solid, but old-fashioned, musical cartoon into something serious, without songs and culture, straightforward and epic, filled with bright colors and aimed at the modern viewer. Here I immediately have a question: Would you like to take the material seriously then? No, it is better to sit on two chairs: try to buy the viewer with colorful, fabulous shots that look crooked, and at the same time bring to the fore the morality loved by Dominic Toretto - ""Family is the main thing"". And then, having calmed down the absurd battle scenes and letting out an artificial tear over a difficult fate, say: ""Yes, we made a movie with meaning."" It turned out poorly. If you remember the original, which could both make fun and give a simple moral at the end, then there is also a clear construction of scenes and dialogues, which is simply not there in the 2020 remake. Here is a collection of quotes, standard images and abstract beautiful backgrounds. $200 million have gone nowhere. The whole film is saturated with artificiality, and the script only makes it worse in this case.
Very difficult to find something positive about Mulan (2020). Disney doesn't try to put out good and interesting adaptations at all. Nobody says that the film should be exactly the same as it's predecessors. But the viewer should be interested. In fact, the graphics, production of the film and the visual part of it are beautiful, but it's not enough to decorate a fairy tale, you need to be able to present it with a good story and script.

Supporting characters have no purpose, and not a single arc between them and Mulan is properly concluded. They reference asian kung-fu movies through pastiche photography, without really understanding how asian cinema conveys its messages. Not to mention their complete failure in attempting to make battles look more realistic through clean soldiers and not a single drop of blood.

All of the characters are memorable without feeling silly. The film is daring enough to make its demands clear. In a time of war there can only be commitment. There is no courage without fear. That is the theme on which the film presents its battles of will from. There is always a line you cannot or are not able to cross. The battle between the two protagonists always stays light which only better conveys subtly showing the perceived empathetic role of women in the society of that time.There is finally a movie that brings a lot of the most famous Chinese actors together in a passionate portrayal of battles that show no deceit. There is nothing sinister in the movie all but a simple victory for those on the right side of history.Even though the film might some to seem to some to be heavy on the main actress the film never forgets that there are others who matter too. A presentation of armies, its composition and their capabilities look believable and the strategies employed are never over the top.Anyways a great movie with great actors. A film with only positive messages all around but still enough meat to spark a conversation about interpersonal issues that any film about a society inevitably shows.

'Chi' in Chinese means 'energy' which boys presumely have plenty so it is ok to be active whilst girls are supposed to be gentle, soft, subdued. Active girls (tomboys) are frowned upon. Whilst the original ballad focuses on the message about filial piety (honouring family), this version focuses first about being 'TRUE' about oneself and accepting who you are (many scenes point to the last word on the sword) and laid in the original message in the end (honouring family) with a new word added into the new sword. The witch was to depict how a rejection of one true self by society can create a monster out of a person.It did not try to take the focus away with a unnecessary love story or music score.

They made a big point of her stupidly going into battle without her armour or helmet which in real life is the fastest way to get killed.

Of course as a Disney film you would expect flaws, but this time the writers and the director used considerable restraint so as not to make it too ""Disneyfied"", as they tend to do all too often. An inspirational story-line for younger girls, was enhanced by, fantastic visuals and an interesting and at times informative historical backdrop, that helped those ignorant of ancient China, to visualize an imagined time and place different from their own. Also you can't be too picky about historical detailing when this movie tends to also pick up on some of the old Japanese movies of earlier times I remember watching. Although very different, Akira Kurosawa movie ""The Seven Samurai"", there were a number of attributes that were certainly taken from other early Japanese movies, such as farcical characters, magicians, witches and sword fighters that climbed up vertical walls, the list goes on. Also we should not forget that this is first a fairy tale for kids, so we should not expect absolute historical accuracy. Mulan 2020 is meant to entertain in an acceptable package aimed at kids, especially young girls. It's fictional entertainment first and foremost, after all. I also think the overly precious critics who panned Mulan 2020 for not being true to the animated version or thought it should be like a documentary on ancient China, should grow up and smell the fairy floss. Mulan 2020 is nothing like Mulan 1998 - and was never meant to be - and for that I for one am eternally grateful.

The lyrical lines doesn't fit at all.They butchered the mountain scene too. Nobody saw Mulan's sacrifice. You can't even feel the rush when the snow fell. It looked good but there was no anxiety for it. I mean Mulan's horse is literally just running in the avalanche like it was normal ground. I didn't once feel any stress. She doesn't even looked stressed at all!They just pushed so much ""Mulan the feminist"" like adding weird details. Like the scene where she reveals herself as a woman and asks to be executed or with the ending where the guard says the emperor is waiting for her to choose what she wants to do.I guess the music was also bad because it didn't help carry the tones to guide the vibe of the scene especially with fight scenes. It was just bland fighting scenes.There's a lot of wrongs that happened. Overall I can say that this is just a pretentious movie. They told us they opted to divert from the Disney animated version to make it more Original.. represent the Chinese culture and yet it's not. I have watched the 2009 Live action Mulan and I cried. I felt that movie more than this 2020. I felt the grittiness and the REALNESS the 2020 was supposedly going for. This 2020 version is lacking. There's no Disney magic. There's no real vibe. It's just in between. Like a dream",NEGATIVE,0.9988294839859008

2020-09-11 00:00:00,"In medieval China, Mulan (Yifei Liu) grew up as a rambunctious daughter with vast reserves of qi. Her father is secretly proud but her mother is concerned with her marriage potential. In the north along the silk road, Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) leads the Rouran warriors on a revenge mission for his late father with the help of the witch Xianniang (Gong Li) who uses her qi for evil. She is able to shapeshift and convinces the Emperor of China to conscript one male from each family. Mulan's father prepares to join the Army despite his old injuries. Mulan steals his armor and takes his place. She pretends to be a man while training under Commander Tung (Donnie Yen).This is a live action remake of the 1998 animated movie. There are choices being made that I understand but about which I'm uncertain. First and foremost, it's the lost of Mushu. While I completely understand the ridiculous problem of Mushu, this version is missing the comedy that Eddie Murphy delivered in the animated version. Somehow, Mulan needs a traveling companion to give comedic relief. It can't be a ghost due to government dictates. My only possible solution is a horse with an inner voice. That may be controversial but the movie needs comedy badly. Another issue is the use of qi which struck me as bringing Star Wars Force into Mulan. I am uncertain with this choice. I'm also confused with Xianniang's motivations. I don't understand her pushing the Emperor into instituting the draft. I don't understand her character during much of the third act. I don't understand her ultimate goals and her actions in driving the story. There are some bad action premise like when the soldiers turtled to hide from the attacking birds. I don't understand that they would be huddling together to give the trebuchet perfect targets. Also, trebuchets are not that accurate. Quite frankly, they really only need to be pinned down by arrow barrages. Mulan should be at the top of the mountain after chasing the mounted soldiers and confronting Xianniang. That way she would be in a position to start the avalanche by pushing a boulder down the mountain. Time and time again, the action scenes feel wrongly constructed like having too many cooks in the kitchen. This movie has various issues but non of them are deal-breakers.",NEGATIVE,0.9969930052757264

Let's just say watching the same exact thing, shot for shot, while nostalgic, is always going to fall short of the original. Kudos to Disney for surprising us with something new, and a character that is both meaningful to the new audience, and still captivates us old-timers like when we were children.Also - costumes, locations, character development, music score, fight choreography (anyone who grew up watching 70s Wu-Tang and 90s martial Arts movies will LOVE this movie), many of these elements made it a Mulan to remember.",POSITIVE,0.9987157583236694

I feel this script is much more thoughtful and meaningful. One key example, is the small but deep difference in the way Mulan reveals she is a woman. In this version, she decides to fight as a woman instead of being discovered while unconscious. It shows more purpose and agency on her part.

2020-09-11 00:00:00,"I loved the 1998 animated version so I was a little worried how this would measure up and wasn't sure what to expect because so often I find that live-action remakes falls short of their animated counterparts. Well, my worries were unfounded because apart from sharing the the general storyboard, this version does not try to be another remake. I can almost visualize the producers in 1997 asking themselves ""should we make this a kids movie or a movie for a mature audience?"" and then flipping a coin. Well, we know that the animated version won that coin-flip but had the coin landed the other way, this is how that mature film would have been made. I think this film is as good as the 1998 version - different, but as good. In fact, trying to comparing the two films is like trying to compare milkshake with beer - sure both are beverages and quench thirst but they're fundamentally different. This version targets a more grown-up audience and the plot has matured. However, that, I believe, is also the root cause of many of the negative reviews you see here - misplaced expectations. Some reviewers confuse that with the quality of the movie - read some of the negative reviews and you'll see what I mean. As I said, this is no longer a movie for small kids, it is mature film that targets a grown-up audience. The plot is well scripted and the fighting scenes are exciting; relatively realistic and not the full-blown martial arts fighting as you'd see in some kung-fu movies. The story is quite engaging and I think it connects more emotionally with the viewer than the animated film which is mostly cute and funny. The plot pretty much remains unchanged: Mulan, who is a bit of a tomboy, tries to protect her father from being drafted to the army so she takes his place disguised as a man and through that experience discovers herself. The values of honesty, loyalty and family permeates Hua Mulan's actions and I found that quite a refreshing change from the usual action / hero / romance films that floods the market. Another thing I loved about the film was the way they captured the scenes; landscapes, architecture and sweeping scenery are amazingly well filmed and I wish my screen was bigger so I could truly immerse myself in the images. Stunning cinematography. Maybe it's the Covid fears but Disney should have been released this film in the cinemas because the televisions at home struggle to do the movie justice. And to wrap this review up - This is in my opinion the best film I have seen from Disney in a long time and It's absolutely worth watching. Don't make the mistake to think that this is the live-action version of the animated film. This is the mature version with a heart....and thank God, without need for comic relief.",POSITIVE,0.987199068069458

It certainly took serious the female theme of living in a male dominated culture.You're likely familiar with the story, Mulan is the daughter of a former soldier. When they are attacked by the antagonist' army, each household must send one male from the family. Mulans father has an old war injury and will face certain death, but he is the only male in the household. So Mulan takes his place, impersonating a man and in the process, risks bringing dishonor to the family.I'll leave out spoilers, but one thing that was a bit disappointing was the absence of Mushu. They replace him with a Phoenix thats more symbolic than an actual character.The acting was good enough to not hinder the story telling and the cinematography was beautiful. I found the fighting sequences entertaining even if embellished the stereotypical tropes in ""kung fu"" type fighting movies a little bit.Don't let the bad reviews pursuade you. Wait until December and don't pay the $30 if you tend to judge live action movies against their animated counterparts. But this movie is good enough on its own.

2020-09-10 00:00:00,"This movie had the opportunity to be so good, but it just wasn't. The one thing that this movie has going for it is that it looks very good. There is some really great scenery in this movie, and the costumes looked pretty good. Other than that, this movie doesn't have much more going for it. The three main problems I have with this movie are: lack of a character arc for Mulan, lack of a compelling villain(s), and contradictions within the film. First off, our protagonist Mulan doesn't really grow as a person during the movie. She does make the decision to stop hiding who she is, but that's not really an investing story. From the beginning we see that Mulan is incredibly gifted, and that the only reason she can't show off her talents is because she's a girl. Her main conflict is deciding whether or not to show it. That simply is not relatable. If we got to see her grow and develop her skills, like in the animated movie, that would be a lot better. Second, the villains in this movie are not compelling. To me, this seems like the writers couldn't figure out who was the main villain. We have Bori Khan, the leader of the Rouran army, and a female witch named Xian Lang. They are mostly working together, but they don't spend much time together onscreen. This means that neither of them really stands out. In my opinion, if Bori Khan was the only villain, this would have been a much better story, and he could have been a compelling character. It would have been more like the animated version, but Shan Yu was actually quite menacing. And third, the movie contradicts itself. This movie is very different from the animated film in tone. This version decided to cut out the dragon Mushu, the comedy, and the musical numbers in order to be more realistic. I think that wasn't in itself a bad idea, and could have worked out nicely, if they had developed the characters better. However, during the movie we see people running up walls that are easily 25 feet tall, swinging curtains as deadly weapons, having people catch and kick arrows, and magic. That definitely took away the sense of realism that they were going for.
In short, this movie could have been really good, but it just wasn't. Some people may find it entertaining, but the lack of story compromised it for me.",NEGATIVE,0.995073139667511

2020-09-10 00:00:00,"To say the movie was mildly entertaining is to be very gracious. I have certainly watched movies that were far worse but for a major blockbuster I truly expected more.This movie kept the plotline similar to the original but cut all of the heart, the comedy and the songs that made the cartoon magical.Why would you cut Mushu (the best part of the cartoon) but then have a witch who can transform into an eagle? Either make this a believable/realistic reimagining of the story or keep the fantasy with the best characters from the original.The casting was actually pretty poor as well, as why spend the money to cast Jet Li when he is barely recognizable and did almost no martial arts. Jason Scott Lee looked terrible and was not very believable as an intimidating villan, I thought I was looking at an overweight Jack Sparrow everytime I saw him.The most egregious of errors though was cutting the songs that made the cartoon magical from this version. Sure they made nods to the songs but it was a major error in my opinion to leave them out.Lastly the story felt rushed, like they were trying to fit it in a tight time window and left half the scenes they filmed out as I did not feel that the recruits going from loveable losers to a lethal fighting force was given enough time which caused the entire ending to feel rushed and forced. In the cartoon I loved and could see the transformation and felt moved, in this version I felt cheated especially without the songs to accompany the training.Again this was not horrible but I will never watch this version ever again. I had to put the cartoon version on immediately after finishing this one to make sure that my opinion of the cartoon still held as I had not watched it in many years and it just reinforced my opinion that this version is far far far inferior and need not exist.",NEGATIVE,0.9995309710502625

This is all my personal interpretation and I feel a lot will disagree with what I am going to say.What I like about the animated version of Mulan is her personality. The animated Mulan is someone who is witty, rebellious, misfit, but at the same time kind and loving daughter. In the beginning of the scene, she was writing down cheat notes on her hand and ending of the scene where all the other ladies were able to open their umbrella at the same time while Mulan had to watch them to know what to do. This scene related to me personally because I was that second grade student that was constantly behind in the class and struggle to to fit in. Mulan is kind of like me who is isn't like everyone else and struggle to fit in as bride/daughter while I struggle to fit in as a student. While in the action film the directors tried to use her sister as a comparison of how Mulan is different from other women but really fail because it just shows Mulan is different just due to her chi talent. It also doesn't really explain to me why Mulan is sad that she will get bride match make.
The next animated scene where Mulan stand up for her father and tried to reason with the guard was another powerful scene. I used to think Mulan was dumb for doing this but now I know this again reinforce her as someone who is misfit or daring of society because she think she is doing something right even though she is constantly told to know her place. It really build her character and why she would go to war for her father preparing to die. She went to war because she doesn't want her father to die and follows what she thinks is right. Whereas in the action film, Mulan was stopped by her relative and was like okay I wouldn't go. I believe even if the cartoon Mulan was stopped she will still make a scene and stand up for her father because cartoon Mulan cared more about family than reputation. The action film scene was a real disappointment because it just shows she is an obedient daughter she didn't challenge the norm. Even after she was yelled by her father she just stayed quiet and obedient. There is no dramatic scene when she decide to go to war and instead just cut to her already change in armor.
Mulan in the action felt like she is lost in her identity and needs a witch to tell him about her identity. Also, I didn't know what the phoenix was there for and later look it up to realize that was supposed to be a replacement of Mushu. Her bride make up was really ugly and make her look like a clown. I mean the court ladies make up look so much better and they could have just follow that.I felt that the action movie want a different approach of Mulan and in the end failed in execution. I feel like if they wanted to do an all mighty Mulan then it could be still done. Instead of saying she was talented because of chi they should say she was talented because she had a much bigger strength than everyone else. Instead of people calling her witch they should have the people pity Mulan's family for her wasted talent and felt that it's too bad Mulan's wasn't born as male. Mulan should play how she struggle with her strength and identify as a women and her struggle to balance both. She should have her dad help her send her to war knowing Mulan's talent in strength. Instead of him feeling regret in the movie for training his daughter. They should show her dad struggling with his own identifies by defying what's norm and letting his daughter go to war because it's the right thing for the family. They should have a scene where Mulan hides her strength because she doesn't want to get sent to the front line risking her chance of getting injured and die. Because if she gets injured or die they will find out she is a women. And they should have more scenes of her personal development with the male interest and why they like each other. Also I think the witch should be the one to reveal her identify instead of the action film where Mulan stupidly reveal herself and really brought dishonor to her family. The core message of the film should be whether she is a male or female she will stand up for what's right and be true to herself. Just like the animated cartoon,",NEGATIVE,0.9937867522239684

Beauty and the Beast to me was better than expected and other attempts no so.However, Mulan is an exception to this trend. I do not see this new Mulan as a live-action version of the animated version, but a fresh new approach to this intriguing legend of woman warrior in a male-dominated society like China.My expectations for this movie was pretty low from what has been coming out of studios these days, but we were pleasantly surprised. It's central theme of devotion to family was very welcome in these times where families are being torn apart. This film has a very spiritual feeling to it.Film was well directed by Niki Caro and the acting was well done. Most of the top Asian actors were present including a cameo by original Mulan voice actor Ming-Na Wen. Yifei Liu did an admirable job playing Mulan.

The stories can be told as seen fit instead of having to follow the footsteps of the Disney animation. I actually prefer this version of Mulan without all the unnecessary humor from the dragon sidekick, the cricket (as an insect) and the romance scenes.That being said. I wished they had followed through with the realism and hence here are aspects of the movie which could have been improved.#1 Fancy VFX that was not necessary and only added to the cringe factor. While the battle actions were great and one that remotely resembles 'wu sha' films, the witch and the phoenix with its plastic/kite looking tail was completely not necessary and did not add much to the plot. Instead they could focus more on Mulan's growth and the battle scenes (which by the way lack any tactics whatsoever)#2 Westernization of the dialogues. Although I understand that targeting the western audience makes bigger bucks in most of the cases, it hindered the overall experience of the movie. The three pillar of virtue for example could have been described in much more in depth if the movie was spoken in Mandarin instead of English. It just made the whole movie seem that bit shallower.All in all, decent and enjoyable watch. Not as bad as some of the reviews make out to be.",NEGATIVE,0.9872092008590698

In one moments she's kicked out of the army for being a woman, in the next she's leading the army in defense of the emperor. There's a side character that is probably the most inconsistent and ridiculous character I've seen in a movie.

An insult to Chinese identity because someone decided to make Chinese actors deliver lines in English (to pander to western audience).In an animation, it is fine to have Chinese characters speak English, because it is a story that does not seek to be ""real"", like a fairy tale. The audience will not be that bothered. The 1998 animated Mulan is an empowering ""fairy tale"" story with Chinese elements inspired by a folklore ballad.When Disney decided to do a live action remake with production design that seems to be aiming for authenticity, the game changes. It is just wrong to force Chinese Actors that can speak Mandarin, to deliver lines (emotion) in English. Language is integral to one's way of thinking, one's personal identity, one's cultural heritage and social image. Forcing Chinese actors to speak English, like they don't have their own perfectly fine full-functioning language that is just as full of nuance and complex communication, is the Ultimate Disrespect to Chinese culture.If they wanted 'authenticity' and to pander to Chinese audience, they should have done this live action remake in Mandarin, and dubbed into English (or subtitled) for western audience, and spent some money hiring Chinese scriptwriter, production staff, who will know the culture intrinsically. The acting would be better if the actors were allowed to use their native language. And from an authenticity viewpoint, it is odd to have a 'realistic' historical folklore Chinese drama in spoken English.From the pander-to-the-western-audience viewpoint, they would have done better to do a shot-by-shot live remake, with all the music and beloved characters of the animated classic.",NEGATIVE,0.9949323534965516

2020-09-10 00:00:00,"Mulan is great. The thing is, everyone keeps comparing this show to the animation. They're in completely different time-frames, targeted at different audiences. If Disney wanted a complete carbon copy of the 1998 animated Mulan, they wouldn't have spent $200 million on this film. Where's the creativity in that? The variation? Just watch it as a standalone, completely new film. Trust me, you'll enjoy it much more.There are a lot of tiny details I missed the first time I watched too. It kinda feels like they wanted to squeeze the film into 2 hours, cos they kinda rushed through the plot. It was kinda hard to catch up with the plot, but watching it the second time helped a lot. Also I couldn't really sympathize with Mulan before rewatching it. I don't know, but maybe COVID kinda affected their filming or something. Only Disney can answer that.Mulan could have done with more sacrifice on her part to add that emotional touch to the film. Her ""qi"" makes her, like, way too powerful.I would also liked to have seen more relationship between Honghui and Mulan. I mean, someone who you just talked to in the dormitories and during lunchtimes definitely isn't worth risking your life for. I could tell Disney wanted to add a little romance, but not too much. Mulan dropped only 2 hints about her liking Honghui, and it would be generous to call them subtle. If they wanted to steer their relationship towards friendship, they could have done so without those hints. For the sake of not spoiling the story, I won't mention those hints here.Visuals-wise, everything is flawless. Expected from a $200 million budget film. Nothing looks fake and plasticky, and the action choreography isn't too bad either. At least Mulan doesn't glide around like a paper aeroplane. I also liked how Mulan used different types of weaponry, ranging from bow to spear to fists. It brings more life to the story, instead of her using only a sword and doing impossible stuff with it.As for the acting, the dialogue could have been more emotional and dramatic. I really liked Honghui's acting, he was able to add that realistic touch to his dialogue without losing the emotion in it. Mulan's acting wasn't bad as well, the tears at the end of the movie when she reunites with her father didn't seemed forced. The witch's dialogue overall was calm and, to be honest, flat, though it probably fitted her role as a supposedly powerful villain.I have no idea why this film got such a low rating.

The changes that the live action made were great because they made the story feel more real. Having a humorous talking dragon and the huns ""pop out of the snow like daisies"" would have probably seemed very cheesy in the live action. In my opinion the live action of Aladdin suffered from being very accurate to the cartoon, lots of parts came off as very cheesy, especially the cringey dance scene. People tend to complain if the live actions don't do anything different or they'll complain if it's the exact same. The changes didn't hurt the movie.

In my opinion it's a nicely shot, suspenseful story with a strong message. Watched it and I would do it again to be honest.I think it is getting a ton of hate because it's from a different culture with different values and instead of trying to understand other's actions, thoughts and motivations people rather hate, protest and boycott. Which sadly selldom leads to peace. That is also a point where I blieve the movie is lacking, the other side is just introduced as plain evil and the side of the protagonist is the talented and well meaning one, and it doesn't work like that in the real world.Also the movie was like ""fantasy"" with elements of magic, and that hurt the credibility of the protagonist a bit, because in hardships the magic was always there to help her so the plot could continue. So the writers were a bit lazy in motivating everything with logical events. But if you see it as a childs movie and pretend that you are a child (which you will have to, because a movie about war only showing blood once is cringe) then it's thoroughly enjoyable.This sounds ironic, but really.

With an open mind and looking to enjoy a good Disney production all I can say is ""Eh"". The story was good and there were small sparks in the acting but none of it never really meshed. Backgrounds and scenery fit in well and it gave me an understanding of Chinese traditions but as for entertainment I am very happy I watched this at a relatives home. I would have been really upset paying 30 dollars to watch this on top of the annual cost if Disney+. But in the end, the stunts were over the top and unrealistic.

2020-09-09 00:00:00,"I hardly ever comment but after all the weird and unfair hate this movie is getting - here I am. Let me start by emphasizing that I'm absolutely fan of the animated Mulan fan and have been from childhood. My very first pair of shoes were Mulan light-up shoes! However, despite many of the movie critics ('cause what do they know right?) liked the movie, some of the audience's critiques (some baseless) started to get to me. After watching the film, I am so glad I didn't listen!I wasn't alone either. I watched the admittedly pricey film with my parents who often get bored with films very easily and absolutely dread childish movies. I was a bit nervous at the beginning when the movie started a little slow but I was relieved to find it was short lived 'cause the movie picks up quickly afterwards. Soon we were laughing, moved, and completely stunned by the beautiful movie all while being on the edge of our seats. I was even crying not even 20 minutes in!I would like to spend the rest of this review answering back to some of the critiques that I've been hearing that I had mentioned above because some are just ... well let's discuss!First and foremost, I felt the film did a much better justice to paint how beautiful, breathtaking, and truly amazing Chinese culture and history is. Are there places where they got it wrong, I'm sure. But is it a step in the right direction? Yes.Second of all, this Mulan rendition gave depth, especially in places in the story that Disney had originally skipped over. One example is how it covered a glaring plot hole in the animation by explaining what exactly was it in Mulan that made her truly different from everyone else to point of her and her family fearing dishonor (giving context to Reflection and Mulan's overall character). It also solidified the supporting cast as actual soldiers instead of being a comedic bunch who happen to be able to throw a punch despite months of military training. Even minor characters such as the the emperor was given more room and not portrayed as a damsel in distress along with the major villain. Each was shown to be a skilled leader with their own goals and history, making me love them way more in this movie than the animated one.Sure there is no Mushu or singing and dancing cast. But now, I'm absolutely glad they weren't in this movie which ultimately uplifted the female empowerment message of the movie. With no Mushu to push her or ""guide"" Mulan, all the burden squarely on her shoulders giving her more agency. Seeing her accept who she is and choosing to follow her heart despite the very real consequences of death or expulsion/dishonor was made all the more satisfying and moving to witness. She didn't need a talking dragon to parent her, especially when it was simply a token character created to make a cultural movie more digestible to an audience who would not have otherwise been attracted to a telling of a cultural folktale to begin with.Side note: I think many misunderstood the purpose of her ""skills"" as something alike to being a chosen one which simply isn't the case because the movie clearly stated that men have skills too. It is only a problem when women possesses the same skills as they are seen then as superhuman or witches. I would like to point out that even in the animation, Mulan was depicted to be the only one who had truly shown to have learned martial arts enough to put into combat use. Comb through the scenes and you will see the difference, that few in the army are shown to progress as far as she does. Rather than viewing this as a chosen one film, I would say that the cartoon and live action Mulan both are quick studies, the live action Mulan picking skills up at an earlier age than the cartoon.No songs were replaced by conversation that achieved the same goal. I almost didn't miss the songs. Don't get me wrong, I still will belt them out whenever the opportunity arises, but now I simply do not look at them the same way. Having that on top of a singing and dancing cast would have made this movie unbearable and cheapen it.Finally this whole ""bad acting"" critique.... I'm sure this is coming from people who aren't familiar with watching foreign movies, expecting each character to fluently speak and express English with an animated face. This being an all Asian cast, with English not being the first language of many in the movie, its unrealistic in my opinion to expect an American accent. So of course the dialogue is going to be appear to be ""choppy"".Now where did this movie fail? There definitely could have been more comedy. At times, especially later, the movie felt rigid and lacked the same charming fluidity that came with the animation. Maybe it was unavoidable because it was dealing with naturally tougher content? Also the action CGI was a little off (for a lack of a better way to describe it) and flamboyant. On the other hand, I see this often with Asian historical action movies. We all know Disney clearly has the resources and money to do better so maybe this was intentional to appeal to the Asian audience? Who knows? But it didn't take away from the movie one bit. There are a plethora of thrilling scenes to make up for it.",POSITIVE,0.8372151255607605

The acting is middling, the dialog cliched and syrupy and the CG passable, a decade ago. But the themes are strong, the storyline while predictable is coherent and overall it does what cinema and Disney do best, it entertains.Yes, it is based in a country that's currently on the nose, the values contradict reality and some cast members have personal views that grate but as a movie Mulan in no way deserves 1 and 2 stars.The same storyline set in any other culture would easily garner more favour.

2020-09-09 00:00:00,"I am still waiting for that all Asian cast American movie that will be the ""Black Panther"" for the Asian community. So far the only proper all Asian cast American movie is Crazy Rich Asian and that was a rom-com about rich people which isn't what I am looking for. The Disney live-action remake of Mulan (1998) is a proper big-budget all Asian cast movie that aligns with what I am looking for. However, Disney live-action remakes have been mostly a miss apart from ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Cinderella"". Mulan (2020) is directed by Niki Caro who won lots of awards for her movie Whale Rider(2002) but it does make me wonder if they couldn't have just hired an Asian director but whatever. The trailers though seem to suggest that this remake was actually attempting to do things differently from the original which intrigued my interest. Unfortunately, due to coronavirus, this movie got delayed and then shoved to streaming with a hefty price instead of going to cinemas. I actually avoided watching the original Mulan recently just to make myself go into this movie with a more open mind and to have a sort of first time watching experience again. Therefore, I am going to avoid comparison with the original in this review. So after watching this, did the movie live up to the expectations?
Note: unlike my previous reviews there is going to be a fair amount of minor spoilers here so be warned.Firstly, visually the movie is quite beautiful. There are some gorgeous shots in this movie such as the martial art practice by the lake, Mulan running on the rooftops and even the war itself was quite visually pleasing. The cinematography isn't ""Roger Deakins"" level of stunning but it is definitely really good looking. This is also elevated by the really good set design and costumes. The set design allows for great scenery and the costumes feel authentic. These really help pull the audience into the movie and the era that Mulan is set in.Secondly, the score by Harry Gregson-Williams who has done the score for movies like Shrek and The Martian does a pretty good job here as well with Mulan. They use a lot of wind instruments that are heard from a lot of Chinese movies and pretty much use them here. The score generally works and it really helps create the atmosphere for each scene really well. Also, the orchestral cover of Reflection from the original Mulan is used in this movie and is just really awesome,Now my gripes with this movie. Firstly, is the lack of emphasis on emotional moments. It feels like the movie brushes over a lot of what I would consider quite important. The scene where Mulan makes the decision to go to war is one of the important decision she makes. However, the movie just has her pick up a sword and then the next scene she is in armor and off to war. We don't get any emphasis on how important this decision was and the sacrifices she had to make until halfway through the movie for some reason. This happens a couple of times as well such as when there is a destroyed town which shows the horror of war but they only spend a couple of seconds here with minimal reaction from the characters and it's then just off to the next scene. Another being a character dying and it's just whatever. The movie feels really lacking in a lot of humanity but there are a couple of banter moments between Mulan and ""friends"" that have some fun in it.On that note of characters, the supporting characters are rather bland. Honghui (Yoson An) acts as a love interest, rival and ally for Mulan which is all there is about him. Commander Tung (Donnie Yen) sort of mentors Mulan and knew Mulan's dad but that's really it. The Emperor (Jet-li) is a badass and wise emperor who barely appears in the movie. Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) who is the main villain also barely appears in the movie despite being the bad guy who started the war. The Witch (Gong Li) who is probably the worst character in this entire movie is like Mulan but bad. These are all the relevant supporting characters but there are others who are so forgettable I don't remember if they even had names.The character arc which is part of the story is not great either. Mulan's decision to finally be true to herself and not hide that she is a woman just sort of happens because she got beaten up. Instead of it happening in a dramatic way it just feels rather random. Also, Mulan is special because she got lots of chi which ruins the message of the movie. Instead of feeling like she earned her place in the army and gaining the recognition of her comrades through her efforts it instead feels like she only got it because she is the chosen one. So the message is now ""be true to yourself only if you're the special one"". The Witch also goes through a character arc as well but it is extremely rushed and dumb. She makes choices that don't even make any sense such as divulging the main villain plans or sparing Mulan constantly or the really dumb choice at the end of the movie. Her addition to Mulan is pointless and if anything took away all the screentime from the main villain instead.The action scenes are also mediocre which is such a shame. Asian movies have always nail action scenes with their amazing choreography but in Mulan it is BORING. The trailers made it seem like it might be in the veins of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" withs it floaty yet elegant style of fighting. However, it instead really plain and overly edited with many cuts.On that note of edits, there are some weird edits in this movie that make it feel like there were important scenes that were cut. Minor spoilers but there is a scene where Mulan is riding a horse towards the enemies army in an open field but then the next scene suddenly has her behind the enemy hiding behind a rock with no explanation whatsoever. There is also a scene where after Mulan has decided to be true to herself in which she saves an ally but makes a choice to disappear into the fog. The next scene is then showing her dramatically coming back to her allies seconds later. It is so weird and took me out of the movie for sure.I also have to talk about our main lead actress Liu Yifei who plays Mulan. She sucks. She plays Mulan with no charm or charisma or even a personality. The tone in her voice is always the same and the only real change in her voice is when she is pretending to be a male with a deep voice. She also makes no expression whatsoever, it always feels like she has the same neutral expression in every moment even when someone died its the same expression. At least Donnie Yen and Jet Li are good in their roles though.Overall, the movie is not the all Asian cast American movie I am waiting for. It is just another inferior remake from Disney. It has none of the fun that was in the original so the movie just ends up being boring. There are some things you can enjoy in the movie with some pretty good moments sprinkled in there. Additionally, it is still pretty much a retelling of the original Mulan so the overall story is still there. It just isn't as good it could have been. Such a shame...",POSITIVE,0.9950149655342102

Of course, suddenly the movie has its very strange clichés and some filler people that do not transcend so much compared to others.

2020-09-09 00:00:00,"I never saw the animated film, so I don't hold the new live action film responsible to live up to any previous standard. That makes me, in my view, a more neutral arbiter of Mulan 2020 as a film consumer.I've read the criticisms of this film, ranging from Chinese national political involvement (listed in the film credits), alleged manipulation of the story's themes to favor the official China government propaganda about the nation, location shoots near the Uighur detention camps, the film's lead actor Liu Yifei speaking in support of China's clampdown on the Hong Kong democracy movement, and criticisms of the creative choices made in the film. While each of these items carries some weight in some perspectives, I didn't let them influence me while I watched the end-product, the film.As a standalone film, given the caveats stated above, Mulan 2020 is solid entertainment, beautifully crafted, with a positive message for the world and young people. The storyline is noble, the central character is a stoic role model, and the possible creative choice disputes can easily be overlooked by a neutral observer.Did I find the Witch problematic, design-wise, as some point out? No, not really, but I can see how she could've been expanded upon further. Except, a filmmaker has to make choices, else the movie runs on for hours.Did I find the Phoenix confusing? Perhaps. I was confused about it at first, thinking it was the Witch, but then, after a while it became more clear -- or, as clear as it was going to get. This element could've been better explained or elaborated or put in some kind of context.Was I pleased with all the casting choices and the dialogs? Mostly, but again why do we need to second guess the process of putting this film together?As to the politics that have been injected into the discussions about Mulan 2020, I'd simply point out that all film locations have some troubled history or ongoing issues, worldwide.Any films shot in the American South and parts of the East Coast are done so on land that once harbored institutionalized slavery sanctioned by the U.S. Constitution. Where's the outrage for that?Should Driving Miss Daisey have been banned or boycotted? Extending beyond entertainment, should the Judeo-Christian Bible be banned due to it's advocation of violence against our 'enemies'?I know these are not a perfect examples, but one must try to have the larger view of the world at times, and for me general entertainment should be largely exempt from some of the justified angst in society, unless (the caveat) the entertainment is blatantly a propaganda tool spreading dangerous falsehoods as truths that seek to stir up greater division and harm. Mulan 2020 does not do any of that as an entertainment product, despite any behind-the-scenes facts or nuances.My first thought as the movie ended was that I would want to watch it again some day in order to absorb more of the creative detail I might've missed. I liked it that much.Kindly spare me any angry rants and entrenched arguments. These are all just my own opinions which I believe are fair minded.",POSITIVE,0.9728409647941588

I do think that a household with just 1 person might not think it's worth paying the $30 on Disney Plus. I have a family of 5 and so it was worth it. But, the $30 price tag will be high for small families. But, I did like it. I wish there had been more character development where you actually see Mulan learn her skills because she is portrayed as a young girl as a do-it-all girl with special abilities. I think it would have been nicer to see a normal girl with courage who teachers herself the skills needed to be a warrior. But overall, I liked the movie.",POSITIVE,0.9993918538093568

However, they don't actually remove the supernatural from this, in fact they add way more completely trash tier supernatural elements into it, done with awful characters and even worse CGI quick cut action. The acting here is bad, the characters are bad, the story and writing is bad and has nothing new, the CGI is awful and makes the whole movie look like a complete mess any time there's any action going on.

Li Gong did a fine job but it was for me the witch just did not fit. Yifei Liu did a good job as Mulan i found her believable and a fine actress, how they found out about her being mulan was again better and more cool in the cartoon. i very much liked Yoson An as Honghui but his story was so much better in the cartoon and the story between Mulan and Li Shang made that story so much better so changing out Li Shang for Honghui was a mistake. think Yoson would have done a very good job as Li Shang and Jason Scott Lee was just bad as Böri Khan and changing the story from Shan Yu again a mistake for me. simply a better character so i dont blame JSL for the acting i think thats more the character and direction then the actingso to end my rantCartoon in every way better

2020-09-09 00:00:00,"Mulan (2020) :
Brief Review -Packed with Action but lacked Humour and Grounding. I watched Mulan (1998) just couple of days back and then took time for this live action remake so that i could evaluate both the films on comparative level. This 2020 version of Mulan is actually little bit different from the animated flick not just in production design or apparent filmmaking but also in basic script for that matter. Mulan is more about a woman having talent since birth but not getting chance to explore it whereas the animated feature was about the Equality she was denied. Here, the girl has hidden and stupendous 'Chi' which she could not show to anyone just because she's a girl and Imperial Army is all about Male warriors while in 1998 version the girl learns the talent along with the male warriors and then bests them all. Somehow, this new film is more driven to fictional adventurous path as you might feel it difficult to connect to the Pheonix Bird angle and Witch part (at least i didn't connect). Subsequently, the humour and comedy level is almost close to Nothing i mean Zero figure, hence making it unnecessarily extended and stretched version of sweet little tale.Mulan tops in action sequences with right use of unbelievable sword and spear fights, ground battle and hand to hand combat. Niki Caro's version to Direct this action adventure feels outdated and too mainstream. In couple of action scenes the link between 2 scenes, ground reality of the stunt and intellegence in execution is missing. Thankfully she emerges to win the emotional quotient with things like family bonding, love, gender equality etc.Performance wise, Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Gong Li, Jason Scott Lee, Yoson An and Jet Lee are tolerable. Too much of village and imperial culture irritates at several occassions therefore taking the main essence away from the storyline. Overall, Mulan is like any other Average entertainer in today's time and if you wish to relieve compromised nostalgia of Disney then give it a watch. But of you Live the same nostalgia then watch the original again that has more humour, gags and simplicity.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest",NEGATIVE,0.995326578617096
2020-09-09 00:00:00,"Honestly speaking, i do prefer the animated original version of 1998 to this movie, because it was abit of comedy with the dragon and the cricket...

2020-09-09 00:00:00,"If you were looking for a live action adaptation of Mulan, then you'll be sorely disappointed. All things Disney were removed so we could be presented with a generic movie such as we have all seen before. My expectations was to see the original movie with real people, perhaps with some minor modifications. What I got was an entirely different story. Thus comparing to its original animated version, the movie would barely get a 1/10 at best.That said, if you come with no expectations and don't compare it to the original, you may be able to rate it a 7/10. It could go higher but they have some issues with character development and there are just too many things that felt forced.I'll hope that in the future we'll be able to see a live action version that includes a little Disney magic.

The strengths are in its colourful design and cinematography that make the landscapes and cities of China look absolutely amazing (it was actually shot near my neighbourhood in New Zealand, but you get the idea). However, there are definitely some issues: 1) Mulan has intrinsic superpowers and is overpowered; 2) Mulan never looks or sounds like a man at all; 3) the action is too smooth and appears (ironically) cartoonish; 4) the dialogue is too cheesy even for a Disney film; 5) some scene transitions are too sudden; 6) the character motivations are not always clear.",NEGATIVE,0.8746666908264159

I didn't understand why the witch used magic but Mulan didn't have her spirit guide, why even mention the spirits if they weren't gonna use them. And I feel like everything was too easy for her, she had no progress, they made her a naturally talented flying warrior.

I love that they give more importance to the ""True"" virtue by relating it to Mulan's storyline. The original didn't emphasize this muchThe setting, although still not accurate, looks better than the originalFor the cons:
The acting was monotonous and not that good. I get that Mulan's maybe an introvert, but the actress' eyes and gestures should show what she feels even if there are no lines. Like the scene where she flew from above with her sword. Where are the emotions in your eyes???The characters. I don't feel connected to the characters. I didn't know them, and the fact that there's no music to introduce them made me feel that they're just background characters and nothing more. Also, the sister is unnecessary. She was just used as a character who would ruin Mulan's encounter with the matchmaker lolThe weaving of the story. a) The film did not highlight how the other soldiers got better in fighting. Not one died in the fight in the end. How??? b) Also, the story arc with the witch is kinda meh. It was just put there as an ornament, and not an important part of the movie. c) Her decision to go to war instead of his father was not highlighted at all. The scene just cut to her riding the horse with her armor on.The love story arc. It's a good thing that the movie did not dwell much in the love story arc of Mulan, but her connection with the new guy kinda seemed forced. It didn't feel organic to me. I just wish that they alloted more time for the two to develop feelings for each other.Overall, the film is still enjoyable. But, if I were to choose which version do I like better, I'd still choose the animated one.",NEGATIVE,0.9993599057197572

I was skeptical at first, but after watching i can say i really enjoyed it. it makes sense that the movie was edited and adapted from it original, it more true to the culture. This is one of there legends and Disney adapted it for a kids movie, and became one of Disney classics. than many years later did another adaptation of it. they changed the movie based of feed back from people whose culture it is. would you rather have more movies like the lion king live action, or something that had the balls to give you a different tale. its not perfect, but i'd rather support and watch this than get more Disney sell out remakes where its the exact same story.

2020-09-09 00:00:00,"It's Disney cheese with an extra pound of stink sprinkled on top. Here's the low-down:1. Donnie Yen was great as always. He's clearly THE martial artist and his acting was good too. Side by side, no one matches with him. His martial arts should not have been that stellar, when the heroine was supposed to be Mulan.
2. Mulan apparently was gifted with extraordinary fighting prowess without being taught anything as a child. A cliche that would have worked is if she was actually taught how to fight...by Donnie Yen maybe? Shoulder shrug to this blunder.
3. Was Jet Li in this movie? Great makeup work.
4. Mulan's village was a bad rip off from Kung Fu Hustle. Disney cheese was added to make the village clean and spotless. In fact, it was clean and spotless in every location of the movie, even extending to the wardrobe and objects. The dad's sword, which was used in prior battle, was spotless and unblemished.
5. Mulan's character could have been so much better developed. With good directing, she would have been much more endearing and charismatic. You don't randomly make her hair curled when she is fighting baddies. The actress did a good job for what it's worth - it's the directing that made her character plain silly and unbelievable.
6. I get it - Mulan is a woman in a male-dominated society. At the end, all the males bow down to her and all of Chinese civilization owes their gratitude. What I don't get is why this has to be in-your-face so obvious?
7. The CGI characters and fighting scenes stunk up the movie. It was also very stylized a la Hero, but the latter actually had stellar fighting choreography (Jet and Donnie obviously) and a coherent story line that was enriched by actual Chinese language, not English.If you want to waste $30 for streaming, have right at it and entertain the little kids.

Many dialogs are poorly written culture-wise from both Western/American point of view or Asian/Chinese point of view. I can get past the predictable plot since it's a live-action remake, but the story is very inadequately executed and several plot-points are absurd and ridiculous. Many times I found myself asking -- ""Huh? Why would they do that!"" Moreover, even though it's marketed as an ""Action"" movie, the movie is also lacking any impressive action sequences which could have made it more entertaining. Battle scenes feel small, and many open-field sets feel confined and cramped. I was expecting LOTR or Avenger level battles but instead, I got a couple of dozen people doing some badly designed and executed martial arts in an enclosed movie set. Don't get me wrong, you have a group of very well trained martial arts actors (Donnie Yen, Jet Li, Jason Scott Lee), but feels like someone from a kungfu store in a strip-mall came up with the fighting sequences.

I understand the movie strayed from the original animation and did not have things like Mushu or the songs. I personally don't think it would of fit well into the kind of movie they remade Mulan as.I also understand it was expensive to buy, but Disney is kind of losing money on this and the movie still needs to make some sort of money that it would of in theaters. For example, if one person buys the movie they can watch it with unlimited people; rather than, each person having to buy a ticket.

2020-09-08 00:00:00,"When Mulan (2020) was announced, headlines and press all over the world had their eyes on this up-coming live-action remake of the 1998 homonymous cartoon. Mulan's filmmakers promised fans a film immersed in the Chinese tradition and culture, true to the original Chinese poem, where the famous heroine first came to life, and stripped from the western details added in the original animation. Turns out the film half followed the plot line set from the cartoon and half tried to get to the core of Chinese history and literature, failing at both tasks. A hybrid film that is westernised in almost all its aspects and presents half backed characters with non-existent or badly executed character arcs, Mulan (2020) is disappointing under multiple aspects. Mulan stars as a superhero who doesn't really have to fight hard and long to prove herself, find her place and achieve the respect of her fellow companions; her strength and tenacity are justified by a misinterpretation of what ""Qi"" actually is - an energy that flows through all living creatures -, that is represented on screen under the idea of a ""magical power"". Hello Force, is that you? The other characters portray the exact same problems: bad characterisation and lack of a cohesive and coherent character development.
Live-actions and remakes are a market that nobody asked for and yet still exists, and this film is the living proof of this statement. Expositional dialogue after expositional dialogue the script has crushed Mulan's character into another Avenger of sorts. If the goal was making the story more authentic, the film has completely missed the mark.",NEGATIVE,0.9979962110519408

2020-09-08 00:00:00,"Apperently removing the musical aspect instead becoming a brave move, turn out to be a dumb idea. There's a lot of point on the movie that will work out so much better with a song, and no doubt build the character development to a decent level at least. But no, they remove almost everything we know about Mulan (the sidekick, the interaction and especially the music) and instead gave us the typical cheap editing drama, not the disney show we are all paying forAt least, gotta admit, the message are good. The Disney rare cases where the girl saving the guys moment are well build, some of the background are stunning, the choreography get my high praise, but all the good thing immediately drown with the flat, soulless Mulan characters, a lazy writings antagonist and laughable finaleOnce again, this heavy budget remake fall into the same mistake they done on the previous Aladdin live action, by making the ending feel EMPTY and RUSHED so the plot can go on. (The worst ending by Disney live action remake so far)
Personally i don't mind the pace become more then 2 hours long, just to added more layer to the character so that the story at least will make senseThe original Mulan story, regardless on lack of a magical aspect, still shine on her own way with the most down to earth princess figure. But the remake itself has wasted a lot of potential of explaining that, and instead giving us with a try-hard mature movie to a childhood expecting audience, without any reason why we must loved this but not the older version of the masterpiece Mulan's 1998 who are the main reason people pay their big cash forBut we gonna accept what we got, and i'm disappointing again",NEGATIVE,0.9990625977516174
2020-09-08 00:00:00,"What a disappointment and waste of time and money on Disney's part. Wasted potential for an iconic feminist Disney animation and powerful story.
Sadly, the only good thing about this movie is the visuals.1. Where the hell is Mushu ? If you're going to tone down the magical/fairytale side of the animated version when bringing it to life, don't strip down the movie from one of its star and most loved characters to then replace it with a magical kite-looking pheonix and a witch (?!?!?). Nonsense.2. Where did all the depth of character and storyline go ? This sort of felt like a very tone-deaf ""look at all the cool fighting slow-motion tricks I've got/wannabe feminist"" film. Mulan's journey, unlike the original version, seems senseless and devoted of any profound emotion. She somehow is born with this inhumane ability to fight and do parkour which just defies the whole purpose of her journey and transformation shown in the 1998 film. In the original, she is courageous, defies all odds, develops into this powerful, witty protagonist (not karate kid warrior) that is motivated by her will to protect, not only her father, but China. You don't feel any of that in this remake.One of the most epic scenes of the animated version is when she FINALLY, after so much hard work, manages to make it up that pole. Now, she is just a born ninja who climbs a mountain when nobody else can because surprise surprise, she is the strongest and we knew it from the start.That moment she decided to let her hair down and tear down her armor in the middle of a war in the snowy mountains... my god. WHAT WAS THAT. Also, no one sees her save her companion while halting the fight with the avalanche which lessens the impact of her heroism and takes away all the magnitude of what she has just accomplished. Also why do her companions threaten to execute her if she ""shows her face again"" but then, 5 minutes later, decide to trust her entirely and let her lead the army into the emperor's palace ? So many things lack in logic and context. SO MANY THINGS.3. How many times can one say ""bring honor"" and ""chi"" in a 2 hour long film. Seriously, overdone.4. THE MUSIC. Oh my goodness, what happened to the music ? The original tracks are nothing less than iconic. They could have at least integrated instrumental versions of them (other than just adding instrumental ""Reflection"" to every suppose-to-be emotional scene).5. The acting... oh the acting. Terrible. The script is generic, boring, dull. This obviously does not help the actors, but jeez. Not only do interactions between characters just feel... uncomfortable, but the wannabe jokes are just terrible and awkward. Everyone's acting seems forced. No character building throughout the movie. You do not get attached to anyone, not even Mulan, not even her ""goofy"" friends. Wow I really missed Chien-Po, Yao and Ling from the 1998 version.
This movie felt like a very generic martial arts, Jackie Chan-style (without the fun and humour) film, lacking in any kind of tone, sentiment or Disney magic. The remake has no soul so watch the original.",NEGATIVE,0.9987099170684814

It has all the classic elements of martial art movies like Crouching tiger hidden dragon, house of flying daggers, hero... Minus the effort put into the plot. Okay, this is supposed to be a ""live action remake"" of a classic.
They couldn't put a dragon but they include a witch who shape shifts. But that's not even the problem.If this was an average action adventure movie with top asian stars and martial arts, it's an okay movie. But this is called Mulan. And there is no respect shown towards the legend of the warrior Mulan and the original animated movie which will be the reason that someone is spending money to watch this on tv.
There's zero character development for most characters, even the warrior who grows through hardship into the final form is not shown, it's just using the chi which was always there since her childhood. The witch basically has no critical application towards the turning point.This isn't a bad movie. It's enjoyable. But it's not Mulan. I'm not even comparing the two otherwise this would get something like 4/10...this is a basic action adventure movie with names like Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Crystal Liu and a basic plot, scenes which are added for visual treats and the warrior lady saves the day (which they did a decent ending and she did it humbly without uttering any cringy lines.

The story is mediocre, at best, and doesn't quite land the Asian vibe, neither the western vibe. I just kind of floats in the middle.Here are some of my main frustration points:Chi. They introduce and talk about chi, as if it is some sort of magic. Everyone has chi, we are told, but we only see two people with ""strong chi"" or ""chi magic"". Mulan and a Witch. It is never explained what chi can do and why it gives someone the power to change forms or turn into thousands of birds or anything...The only explanation as to why Mulan is so naturally gifted, is because of ""chi"" - which she apparently has more of than average. From the start it is established that Mulan is ""over-powered"" and apparently is quite masterful of many things, without needing to train or earn her power. This sets us up with the feeling, that Mulan will overcome anything without having to put in much effort, which makes her very hard to connect with as a character.The side-characters are boring. They introduce Yao, Po and Ling, Cricket is also a person apparently. There are a few interactions, and honestly seeing those guys together is quite nice. Too bad we get very little time to get to know them. They also created a new character, Honghui, who acts like a ""love interest"" throughout the movie, until the end where Mulan decides ""No, I'm a 2020 women, I don't need a man"" and she leaves without him. What was the point of even adding him? Just DON'T have a love interest AT ALL if this is the message you want to send. She clearly liked him, so why leave?They introduce this Witch character, who can shapeshift and is a master warrior. Creating this character is rather uninspired. Not only that, she - and the change they bring with her, aka ""chi magic"" - seems to actually go against some of the teachings of the original 1998 movie. The women of this movie (the Witch and Mulan) are only as good/better than the men because they have this (unfair?) advantage of magic chi. The original movie taught us that resourcefulness and intellect is what gets Mulan her victory, but this movie teaches us that if you are born with extra power, then you can win. It's a strange message.Apparently a lot of people can catch arrows mid-air, just before they get hit. This becomes a thing throughout the movie and it's a bit stupid. It almost becomes a point of the movie, since the villain dies to an arrow which he did NOT catch. That arrow was kicked off by Mulan (yes, kicked... She kicks arrows and spears and.. Don't get me started).The Witch can take form of any person, often flies around as a falcon, and can shoot ninja-stars with lightning speed. Major plot hole: Why didn't the Rouran raider leader just ask her to fly to the Imperial City, fly up to the emperor, take him out and throw the country into chaos? Afterwards they could swoop in while the army and the cities were in disarray, and they could have taken over the country without suffering too many losses. Instead they use her to speak with the emperor (privately, that is) and lure him into an unfinished temple...Finally the villain actually captures the emperor (not before Mr Emperor slaps some bad guys to death with a curtain of course - no I'm not kidding, it's a curtain). The bad guy doesn't kill the emperor yet, because like any other villain he must do it in some elaborate way. So, he has some melted steel and some torches and wants to burn the emperor alive.Overall a lot of minor things that I didn't really like:
The scenes between Mulan and her father are slow and don't feel as emotionally strong as they do in the 1998 version.In the end Mulan loses her fathers sword and says ""I now know how much that sword meant to you"" but, like, how does she know that? They didn't tell us or show us why this sword was important. There was no ""this was my fathers sword, he earned it when blablabla."" or ""It has been in my family for generations"" or any of that stuff. Just a sword, dude.We don't see any other witches or hear why they are feared. I mean, the Witch shows is why they fear her, but she explains her own backstory that people distanced themselves from her because of her power. Why did people fear her, before she even started doing bad things? It's not explained. Suddenly it doesn't have anything to do with being a woman, but has all to do with this magical power which no-one even explains to us.It doesn't have any of the lighthearted Disney moments and it doesn't have a strong emotional impact.Overall: Uninspired, boring and full of clichés.

Alongside that, It's always great to see women stand up for themselves against those who belittle them. Overall I thought It was an enjoyable watch that makes you feel a little something in your heart.The negative reviews are pretty much brought on due to politics & preset expectations that the movie is bad due to the difference between live and animated versions.Though, I feel that it bears many similarities to the animated version. What the critics missed is how they varied in certain ways. Mushu was not there in the form of dragon but in the form of a phoenix. His purpose was to look after Mulan throughout the journey after being told to do so by the ancestors, this is exactly what the phoenix did. It helped her in times of need. Phoenix & dragon go hand in hand in the Chinese culture which I think is beautiful because when combined, the movies possess the Yin and Yang.

Characters lack depth (e.g. Mulan's sister, troop ""friends""). Villains - unconvincing, NPC-like, similar to imperial guards.
Character development lacking: Mentions of ""chi"" almost like a superhero-like power. Effort, teamwork and kindness, is thrown out the window. Mulan is a warrior born flexible, active, and able to defy gravity.

But beyond that, on the story merit itself - it stand its ground and Yifei wonderful performance capture the essence of Mulan. Niki has a sensitivity which raise the quality of this movie higher.for a western director to understand the soul of the Chinese culture, I will give her high marks for this. To add colour and beauty into the set and the cinematography, kudos too in the line of the Zhang Yimou etc - set piece and so on. It was delicate but strong, beautiful and elegant.This is not the Mulan of the Disney carton which is a soulless work which panders to the western idea of how such stories should be. That is why it didn't resonate with the Asians watching that - it was a farce with songs. I would much prefer Frozen if I want to watch something in that mode which is true to the core of that story.The reason why a lot of reviewers don't get it especially those from the western culture is, they don't understand. What I say next will probably piss them off, but it is basically the lack of soul , the lack of depth in their own culture and history. That is why I said Niki to her credit, was able to capture the. essence of it as a non Chinese. The other reason is just misplaced notions that they are helping someone by protesting or writing down this movie. The movie should be examined on the basis and merit of its script and work alone and not be imbued with the US-China ""war"" going on. 90% of the review here has really nothing to to do with the movie per se.In the end, in future it won't matter as the younger generation moves about more and there are more sharing of such worlds and listening and people will be aware of different cultures and norms and learn to accept and even appreciate it. This movie opens a door for others to share in that folklore which must transmit the soul of the movie - which is universal - it is about family, devotion, loyalty and as Jet Li and Donnie has succinctly put in, the other element which was added by Niki...true - true to yourself - how true, both cultures are slowly merging and finding universal things in themselves and this is why this movie works for meYifei convey the new Chinese girl who did what she has to do to protect the family she love - she did not run away , she took the load.

Compared to other live-action remakes, I think that this time Disney made overall a decent job, however there are a few things that really bugged me.Some iconic scenes were shorted or completely removed. A lot of key characters were missing. Everything was built around Mulan, that is the only hero. In the original movie Yao, Ling and Chien are essential for the development of the main character. Mushu that is one of the most memorable character in the Disney universe, was completely removed, to be replaced by a phoenix that does not even speak. I highly doubt that Disney did not have the money to create a CGI model. I was waiting for him for the whole movie, but unfortunately he never appeared. I don't expect an exact copy of the original 1998 cartoon, but these things were essential.The acting job of Yifei Liu should be better, there are some scenes where she is decent, but most of the time her interpretation is very flat. This problem extends also to the rest of the cast.I am very surprised that Disney with access to all this technology cannot create something nice and that almost every original movie is still better than these live action remakes.

2020-09-08 00:00:00,"Dear Disney,I already had Disney+ and you made us pay an extra 30 bucks on top of our subscription to watch this movie.Now, if you're gonna charge 30 bucks for people to watch a movie, the movie better be so good that I end up raving about it for years to come. But instead, you wasted my money, time, and left such a bitter taste in my mouth.There were the very, very few good things I can pick apart from this movie, but a grand majority of this movie is a cesspool.So here are the 'good' things about this movie-
-NO SONGS! No opportunity to BUTCHER the classic songs we love. THANK YOU!
-The actor for Mulan's dad was great. Probably the best actor of the entire thing.
-Cinematography looked good. Plenty of frame shots I would definitely make into a screensaver if I wanted to.
-Costume design was beautiful.And that's all the good I can really lay down.This movie tried to take itself so seriously, that it turned into a joke. And not a funny one at that. There were moments where I burst out in sudden laughter at how ridiculous some things were. Basically, for the people that don't know, this movie is not trying to replicate it's animated source. It's trying to adapt the original Chinese folk song/ballad about Mulan. So the original implication was that there would be no magic, no slapstick comedy, no musical moments. A serious and meaningful war movie. Did we the viewer get any of that in the one hour and 50 minutes we were watching this?Nope. The acting was flat, the plot was a mess, suspension of belief out the window in probably less than 30 minutes because they added a certain subplot last minute that tried to make sense but just confused me even more than I already was about the movie. The fight choreography was not all that impressive. Some of it laughable. And lastly, there's genuinely no heart to this movie. It's such a blatant cash grab, and I'm annoyed that yet another one of my favorite Disney classics got a live action reboot where they butchered everything.I'm actually making count now. So far, we've had live action reboots of Cinderella (decent), Jungle Book (fine), Beauty and The Beast (Awful), Aladdin (Awful), The Lion King (Atrocious), and now Mulan (Awful).Strap in your seats fellas. Next is live action Little Mermaid.Until then, all I can say to Disney and Bob Igher is, DISHONOR ON YOU, DISHONOR ON YOUR COW! Wasted my money for yet another piss poor live adaption. STOP with the live action remakes and make NEW original stories.Save your money people. Go watch the original Mulan on repeat with your kids.

Sometimes they have lame fighting styles, other times they just randomly throw in something out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and not in a good way, but it's all really boring. They also took out all the interesting characters, like Mushu, Shang, Cricket, Mulan's grandmother, Mulan's 3 army friends, and instead we get these pointless nobodies who have little to no role other than simply being there. They even gave Mulan a sister, but she adds absolutely nothing; you can take her out of the movie and it changes nothing. Oh, and there's no Shan Yu either, instead we get these two generic, boring villains with no character. And let's not forget the inclusion of chi and actual magic and witchcraft. And, of course, Mulan is an overpowered Mary Su who, even as a child, was performing moves that would put Jacki Chan to shame. I mean, why not give her actual development in training and stuff to show her becoming a good fighter when you can just make her super OP Mary Sue right off the bat, right? The acting itself is bland, and even the dialogue is horrible. Everyone talks in these tone-deaf monotone voices with no emotion in them. You really feel nothing for any these characters. The movie has none of the charm of the original, and they don't even have any of the songs. Seriously, the movie is an utter disaster, and completely boring.

Villains were turned from fierce bloodthirsty army into black Naruto style magician ninjas (they literally run vertically up the wall) who look like assassins.
The longer I was watching the more ridiculous film become with sudden character changes, non logical plot points, absolutely horrible ""final boss"" fight and changed ending that undermines the whole point that Mulan was trying to make.

2020-09-08 00:00:00,"Disney films are often targeted towards kids, but Mulan is a story that has been known for many years now and I understand why Disney felt the need to also stylise this movie in such a way that it would be enjoyable for adults who grew up with this story as well. However, I feel that Disney has completely failed by not adding enough in multiple areas to critique.The plot 1/10:
I went into this movie blind and didn't know about whether Disney chose to change the plot or not. Jumping right in however, it was clear immediately the plot would be drastically changed. Mulan is shown to have powerful skills already rather than training to become powerful. I kept myself open to this idea, however, in retrospect I see this choice of change as a cop out from Disney in terms of creating any real plot progression or character development in this film. Characters aren't developed well... names of characters are not even memorable. Supporting characters felt as if they were used only to bring about nostalgia. For example, Yoson An's role as a newly introduced character, a rival recruit to the character of Mulan, appears in the lake which Mulan washes herself. However, this scene doesn't feel deserved with the fast progression of the plot and simply felt inserted in to create nostalgia for adult viewers.Just as a side thought... Some people may also bring up the point of the phoenix in this film. I believe there is symbolism of rebirth for Mulan with the use of a phoenix instead of Mushu, but would kids be able to make this link themselves?Action 3/10:
Big name action stars Donnie Yen and Jet Li bring about a lot of promise for the action scenes in this movie. Donnie Yen suits his role as the training commander well displaying his skills beautifully. However, Jet Li being the emperor displaying skills felt out of place. Overall, the direction of action scenes in this movie felt promising at first where scenes such as running up walls felt homage towards traditional Chinese action film. However, I was thoroughly disappointed with the choice of no blood or visible injuries. This is probably a choice to keep this film suitable for children but I feel this takes away the intensity of the action. In conclusion, my opinion on the action in this film is that although there is good choreography, I am disappointed with the visual effect choices Disney has gone with. Simply not enjoyable as an adult viewer. However, what really makes my rating of the action not even have a pass mark of a 5/10 is that some scenes just feel extremely illogical. Why did the witch need to throw herself in front of the arrow for Mulan? Why did Mulan have to close the doors behind her as she headed towards the emperor? Why does the enemy commander jump on top of the beam, balancing out the beam and allowing Mulan to climb back up?Sountrack 0/10:
Don't expect any singing. My opinion is that characters bursting out in song is unique and core to the image of Disney films. I'm sure both kids and adults would have appreciated any inclusion of music. I don't know if this was a choice made due to political correctness due to the nature of some of the original Mulan movie's songs.This is my first review thanks for reading if you did.",NEGATIVE,0.9983859062194824

Although different is not bad, and I very much respect the fact that they changed it up rather than creating a complete copy of the animated film, this movie is very mixed in what it does. Before I begin to really ""critique"" the film, let me explain the good elements of this film.
Right off the bat, the first I will say is that the cinematography is amazing in this film. Out of the many recent Disney remakes, this film that had one of the most visually appealing cinematography. There were so many ""WOAH"" shots that took my breath away. Even better, the colors complimented it so well and made everything feel alive. I also enjoyed the casting and overall performance from the actors. Although it was a little annoying to hear some actors with American accents and some with Chinese accents, it wasn't as big of a deal to me. Unfortunately these features were not enough to
Now onto the cons. I feel that sometimes this film doesn't know what it wants to be. It tends to avoid many of the magic elements from the animated original (the ancestors, mushu, etc.) and made it look like a historical. But then again they added other elements like chi and witches. This confused me a little bit. They made it seem like a historical-type drama in the trailers but continued with the fantasy. And if I must say so, the animated film felt much more ""historical"" than this one. I don't know much Chinese history, but this film did not convince me that they were living in a real place. As I said, I feel they didn't establish what type of film they were trying to make. It doesn't feel magical but it also doesn't feel completely gritty and real either.
Our main character Mulan also suffers from a terrible syndrome that has been seen in many other Disney films (StarWars episodes 7-9). Unfortunately Mulan suffers from the Mary Sue syndrome, which states that she is a character that is too ""perfect"". Right from the beginning young Mulan already knows everything and has it all perfect. She is a skilled fighter with great reflexes prior to even going through training. Even then, the training scene does not show herself as learning anything. It seems almost as if that scene was useless and more or less a tribute to the original film. The original film did a better job of showing the struggle she went through, being that she was a woman competing with men. If they would've fixed this, it could've saved it a little more in my opinion.
In general, this film was an enjoyable Disney film to watch with family. But as a cinema-lover myself, I can't say that I was sold on it. Images were beautiful but was not enough to save it. 5/10",NEGATIVE,0.7543452382087708

There are also emotional moments and a strong message that permeates the story throughout the movie. However it is all done in a pace that does not seem natural. Strong scenes cut to a dozens of seconds, no time to develop the majority of characters to make a real connection to them and even to remember their names. Some flashback scenes of the so called ""last great battle"" would greatly improve the the antagonist weight.And last, but not least, the whole magic question. To strip it of Mushu and Cricket and the songs was a smart move to make it more a drama and not mock on the legend. But to make it up with a shapeshifting, doppelganger witch to fulfill the role was really a valid choice? In my, opinion, no. And her cheap and foolish death is the best proof of that. She is completely expandable to the story.
I would give it a 7 but, personally, I was only aware Donnie Yen and Jet Li were in the movie when the credits rolled up. And not because of the characterizations, but, again, for the lack of development.",POSITIVE,0.9905058145523072

If you expected that, yes, you will also be disappointed.

The old way of keeping women in women roles was hit upon greatly in act 1. But it didn't deliver. In act 2 it built up this sentiment by coupling it with the high goals of honesty and truth as means to honor your family, your clan, your country. In act 3 it just turned on a dime as though nothing from act 1 or 2 had any bearing. The powers that be just said, ""welp, guess we will give you the keys to the kingdom then since you didn't want to stay in your place."" WEAK SAUCE!In the cartoon it built on this idea by sparing mulan's life because she saved the captains life, but that she was hence forth banished. It was only when she went against that banishment at risk to her own life, that she taught the captain that even a woman could do right thing.So many things could have been done to enhance the message that women are equal...but if they wanted to just show that women are equally as powerful as men, then why play the gender card in acts 1 and 2. They could have just told a fictitious retooled version of mulan in which the army was already co-gendered. Done.But this movie took this otherwise powerful message and just flopped it. If I show this to young ladies and girls in my life, the only lesson I can teach them from this is that it's fiction and if you really believe in something you have to fight for it. Not just have all the opposition bow and curtsy to your defiance and cultural taboo behaviors.This is the only Disney Princess I liked because she felt real.

I've never seen a movie with that much stereotype of the Chinese culture. If anyone was a bit serious about the cultural content and did a decent research, this wouldn't have happened. By research, I mean something more than just a poem describing Mulan. (Not to mention how awkward it is for trying to fit the content of the poem, word for word, into the movie) The original cartoon was a million times better than this one. How did Disney manage to backwards on cultural representations with lighting speed while have this all Asian cast?
And to be honest, this plot is so bad. I don't even theres any actor/actress that could have saved it. The two points was for Yifei Liu. She's beautiful. The witch was played by my favorite actress. Now I'm having serious doubts on her ability to pick roles. This is the intellectually insulting part. The witch character is so dumb and stupid that after the first line you can guess what she's gonna do and how she's gonna end up. It could have been much better if the Phoenix and the hawk were merged into one character.

There's a lot more violence and it contains more of the action of a Marvel movie than a Disney.The story was good (and pretty similar to the cartoon version), and the actress who played Mulan (Yifei Liu) did an awesome job at playing Mulan! The action was there (and arrows and spears in people), and scenes were beautiful (with mostly convincing digital effects), but there a couple of problems related to this movie's release. First, this IS a ""BIG screen movie"", not a ""movie for home"", meaning the small screen of the house actually hurts the movie. The story itself was good, but something just seemed to be missing in it. A lot of character development just didn't seem to be in this movie. IMDB rates this a 5.6 (user review average at time of this writing). I'd have to agree with that. And what I've found is a movie under a 6 just isn't a great movie (a movie at a 5.6 or better is still worth seeing).... and with ""Mulan"", that's a shame because I truly believe it could have pulled about a 5.9 to 6.0 if release on the big screen (at least al little better).This is a first time saying this, but I would NOT watch this on TV or through Disney+, but WAIT to see if it does come to the big screen!!

There is only 1 truly mass combat scene, and it is so boring. The editing focusing from the bigger fight to small individual fights was not smooth.Fight sequences were BAD. They likely did not spend $200M of their budget to hire a proper martial arts director. Instead of true martial arts fight sequences, they delivered straight-up westernized fighting which is likened to street fightingThe strength of the Rourans is consistent. At the start, they are this fearsome group of warriors that strike fear to their enemies. At the end, they were so weak that they couldn't even stand against a bunch of new recruits that did not even complete their military training fullyOverall editing is weak. The movie seems to be pieces of scenes merged haphazardly togetherThe entire culture aspect is JUST WRONG. I heard they used scriptwriters that were non-Chinese. Examples include the following: (1) Translation of the Chinese words on the sword was incorrect. Instead of ""Loyal, Brave, True"", which isn't exactly correct in terms of grammar, it should be ""Loyalty, Courage/Bravery, Truth'. (2) Which emperor wears GREEN??? This is ridiculous(3) No emperor ever leaves the city without soldiers. It is completely ridiculous.I feel like DIsney could have done a better job studying Chinese culture for a $200M movie, instead, they forsake proper research and settled with scriptwriters who do not know anything (ZERO) about Chinese culture.If you were to ask me what is good, really not much...

like it's too much like a ""Chinese Fantasy Film"" give me a break!
""Why have they cut the songs out""
Story was a little fast paced that's the only negative I have.
But the Story was good, and not a total remake of the cartoon so that was great!
Cutting the singalong out great idea! No one expects a warrior to burst into a stage song the night before battle.

I'm going to compare this version to the original a lot but bare with me. In the original, Mulan take her fathers place to go to war in order to save him and show that she is stronger and more determined than any man; but in the live action, she has....powers? This totally cheapens the story and contradicts the fact that they got rid of Mushu to make the story more ""realistic"". Also, there's a witch with the power to turn into a bird and a human but she chooses to be a side kick to Khan. Just why? In the original, Mulan cuts her hair and drops her voice real low to make her seem like a man. In this one, she just ties up her hair and drops her voice like 1 octave. She looks AND sounds exactly like a woman!
No disrespect but the actress was so mis-casted. She showed virtually no emotion and sounds like she was reading off of a cue card.
Honestly if the witch wasn't in the movie, I don't think anything would've changed. She really didn't bring much to the table and sacrificed herself for no reason.
All in all, this movie was a huge let down and is by far the worst of the Disney remakes. If they did a Lion's King shot for shot, it would've made this 100 times more enjoyable.",NEGATIVE,0.9989300966262816

Only cinematic issue I had was the sound design. Felt off somehow. Perhaps they filmed it in several languages or something and a lot of the fights and explosions and such do not hit the mark. This is the only really bad thing about the movie; the sound design.
Mulan is also a bit too Disney-ish sometimes. There is no blood, no real danger, and if you have seen the animated original there is nothing really new. I also think they could have done a little better with some fight scenes and perhaps a couple of actors were not spot on.BUT, with that said;The good!
Almost everything else. This is just as funny as the original. Great characters. Great story. Great acting. Great directing. Great cinematography (except sound design and a few fight scenes). This is a great family movie. Despite some violence, the Disney-ish with no blood etc make this a great watch for the whole family.I really enjoyed this movie. It is not perfect, but its entertaining and fun from start to finish. Loved every second of it. If they'd nailed the sound design, put more effort into the fight scenes and exchanged perhaps 1 or 2 actors, I would already state that this is the best movie of the year.

2020-09-07 00:00:00,"Unfair low rating from those who had expectations of it to be more like the original animated Mulan just because it's made by Disney. If you watch it from a fresh set of eyes / with no expectations, it would be a great movie as a live action film in telling the story.
Although, I must admit, it did feel quite rushed with some screen time given to the villains lore, but overall distributed.
Another point to note is that Disney is making it more realistic / different as they wanted to portray a version different from the animated classic. If everything were like the originals, there would be no point in remaking it action for action like a mirror, might as well watch the classic itself. As reference to Will Smith as Genie in Aladdin, he had some huge Robin William shoes to fill but he took a different approach as not wanting to be like the original Genie but added his own style. That's what we need for Disney to be more creative and advance further to bring us more stories we love. Just to name a few - Frozen, Pocahontas - stories that wouldn't be the same one we all came to know and love if they had based it on the actual stories they made the movies from.
So yes, it doesn't have to be like the original, if you want the original, watch the classic, don't bash it out on the life action film because it's not meant to be like the classic with its serious scenes of war and fear of being exposed.",POSITIVE,0.5026215314865112

Despite this there are some very powerful scenes in this movie that actually gave me goosebumps and overall made me jump from my seat in excitment and absolute awe, like for example the scene where Mulan discards her armor and we hear ""Reflection"" playing on the background.I also really loved the relationahip dynamic between Mulan and Xian Lang , even though they chose different paths I liked that instead of fighting they found common ground, afterall these characters are the reflection of each other: two women with amazing strength and talent who were shunned because of their gender.Overall this movie is not a masterpiece, it lacks simplicity , some things were way too far fetched like the apperance of the phoenix who wasn't necessary yet could some kind of allusion towards Mushu, the fact that Xian Lang is a witch is completely unecessary to the actual plot and even the ""romantic relationship"" between Mulan and Hounghui is not only rushed but also completely meaningless and kinda cringey since it has no actual development and only appears in the end of the movie without any hint prior to that moment.Nevertheless it is a good movie, which exhales female power and brings a fresh perspective on main female characters giving a modern approach to an already beloved character.",NEGATIVE,0.9916495084762572

Whilst I do understand that this film was made for the general public who might care more for the theatrics than the emotional side of the story, I believe that the emotional story really is an untapped potential of this film.Personally, I found this film to be more comedy than any other genre, though it was probably due to the atmosphere I was watching it in. Sitting with my family and watching this film, being able to critique each and everything that happens without being shushed by other movie goers will definitely be a fond memory of mine that I have made. Whilst there were many mistakes in this film, I believe that the cast is not one of them. The acting was superb. With a better execution, this film would have probably been an amazing film.Hence, I will say that while this film has had many mistakes, for the general public, you might not find it so bad.

For example, while the animated movie moves very quickly through Mulan's decision to go to the army and her training, the new movie lets us experience her physical and emotional journey much more thoroughly. We get to see Mulan having to live with the men in the army and her fear of being found out. Mulan's decision to disguise herself as a man to save her father is one of the most important aspects of the movie. The new version gives us a much better picture of what that must have been like for Mulan (in the animated version, she lives in a mini tent by herself and doesn't seem to struggle too much with being a man and risking her life). Also, we liked that Mulan had been training as a warrior most of her life, while in the animated version she becomes a war hero in a very short amount of time. Also, while Mulan was brave and smart and learned some skills in the animated version, she wasn't really a skillful warrior. For the new Mulan, being a warrior was what she was born to do and we loved seeing her in the fight scenes.You could argue that the use of chi and the witch's role were not really necessary and took away from the film, but since they decided to go with those elements, they did a good job in how they incorporated them.We loved how the new movie included the avalanche like in the animated movie, but we wished the other soldiers would have realized that Mulan had saved their lives. In the animated movie we have two important moments that come from this situation: Mulan saves her team (including Shang) and she comes face to face with the villain before the avalanche starts. Unfortunately, we didn't get either of these in the new movie.Overall, this is an epic movie that gives us a more vivid and real picture of the story of Mulan. While we think some of the storyline could be improved, it is a great movie and very enjoyable.",POSITIVE,0.9979971647262572

2020-09-07 00:00:00,"I waited for months in anticipation and excitement for this movie, knowing that many great actors/actresses are involved. But after watching, I'm not only disappointed but angry & disgusted as well.First and for all, there's already a huge damage done to this chinese period film when the movie's dialogue is in english, because the essence, the emotions and the culture are not accurately conveyed. Who says Disney movie can't be in mandarin? If their animated version can be dubbed in different languages, then who says this live-action version can't be filmed in mandarin?Second, it's really a pity Lee Ang turned down the offer for the director of this movie. I feel that Niki Caro has done a really terrible job here. She doesn't know the strength of her actors & actresses, she doesn't know how to direct them into showing the correct emotions. Many times I felt the expressions and emotions of the actors/actresses were so so weird. And she definitely does not know how to bring out & convey the essence of a chinese period drama culture. So many emotional scenes that could potentially help the movie develop into a more exciting level were sloppishly done and abruptly concluded. So many huge stars were involved, yet I feel that their talents had been wasted here.The push factor (fight scene between Gong Li and Li Yifei at the battlefield) for Mulan to reveal her real identity is so weak. The scene where Mulan tries to convince the Commander that the king is in danger is also effortless and lousy. The witch's switch of alliance is also so weird, and without proper development. The defeat of Bori Khan was so easy, like a child's play. OMG..... Did Niki Caro think that she was filming an animated film? *shake head*Third, there are 2 huge action stars in this movie (Jet Li & Donnie Yen), why is it neither of them was invited to choreograph the stunts?!? Everytime I watch the fight scenes, I get so frustrated because they made every single one of them look like an easy defeat, no development, nothing challenging & exciting at all! Yet again, a waste of great talents (Jet Li & Donnie Yen).Fourth, lousy editing! During the scene when Mulan's family were talking about her father's enlistment, the different angle shots they used were so terribly wrong! In one shot Mulan's arms were crossed, then in another shot it wasn't crossed, and the next one was crossed again! Seriously?!?Last but not least, can't they do a better job at finding the right actor for Honghui's role?!? There was no chemistry between An Yoson & Liu Yifei at all! OMG....In short, ""Just like that?"" repeatedly came into my mind throughout the whole movie.
Mulan managed to conceal her identity and blend into the army ""just like that""?
Mulan felt compelled to reveal her identity ""just like that""?
The commander and the others believed her suspicion ""just like that""?
Bori Khan and his army arrived at the Imperial City ""just like that""?
The witch suddenly betrayed Bori Khan ""just like that""?

That being said, this live action adaptation takes more inspiration from the legend of Hua Mulan than the 1998 animated version does, which I find to be fresh. It's a very colorful movie, and the richness of color combined with beautiful backgrounds and landscapes, as well as set pieces makes it a feast for the eyes. The movie is also well choreographed and the fighting is very believable, and the score and music are also very well done.The characters of Hua Mulan and her father all feel really fleshed out. There is very little character development other than that, sadly. The rest seem almost like cardboard-ish cutouts. Also, there is very little humor and the absence of the character of the wisecracking sidekick Mushu is very noticeably felt. (Although, the lucky ""Crikee"" does make an appearance in one scene).Also, it's clever that the filmmakers snuck Ming-Na Wen (the voice of Mulan from the original animated movie) into a cameo towards the end of the film.It's not a bad movie whatsoever. It's got a solid story, believable characters and action sequences, and gorgeous scenery and cinematography. However, that being said, it does leave something to be desired.

The film is directed by Niki Caro, the director of Whale Rider and The Zookeeper's Wife.In the film, the Chinese Empire is attacked by a rebellious Rouran army led by Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee), who receives help from a witch Xianniang (Li Gong). The Chinese emperor asks each family to send a man to join the Chinese army, so that they can fight the enemy army. Because Mulan (Yifei Liu) her father is the only man in her family and he cannot join the army due to his old age and shortcomings, Mulan decides to pretend to be a man and enlist in the army. Here she has to hide the fact that she is actually a woman, in order to keep the honor of her family. For example, she starts training undercover to support the Chinese army and in the hope of remaining in control of the rebels.Director Niki Caro and cinematographer Mandy Walker have portrayed the film in a beautiful way. The Asian culture is clearly shown in the film. The film beautifully shows the mountainous areas in China. Apart from the beautiful images, the film is unfortunately not that special. The problem is more with the script, how the film tells its story and how they put it all together.
Unlike the animation, Mulan in this movie doesn't really need to train herself to become a real warrior. As a result, her character lacks the structure that the same character had in the animation. In this film they try to bring out more that women, just like men, can also be warriors for the army. Despite the good intentions of this post, the script and how they bring Mulan up from the beginning also let it go.
To make this movie a bit more respectful to the Chinese audience, they kept the popular character of Mushu, who was voiced by Eddie Murphy, out of the live-action verse. By removing this character, the film loses many of the comedic moments that the animation does have and this film comes across a bit too serious and becomes more long-winded.Unfortunately, the effects also come across a bit frayed in the film, so you can see where they used CGI or a green screen.Unfortunately, the characters are not that special in the film. Most of them play the soldiers of the Chinese army, but are not really developed further in the film except for a few moments. Yifei Liu does portray the role in a fun way in the film, but due to the lack of structure of her character, she does not come forward that much. Donnie Yen knows how to provide some small comedic moments as the commander of the Chinese army, but he has also done better and more comical acting in his other films.This movie can be seen on Disney + at a rather high price, which the movie is actually not worth.

All the beloved scenes from the animated Mulan were changed, so it could be more realistic, but it was terrible.

It was awful. Every single detail was changed to the worse, and I'm a fan of making changes in live-action remakes. Not a single character was interesting. The fight choreography was absolutely awful. The quality of the visual effects loudly says ""we don't think this will sell, but we're doing it anyway"".
Judging this movie as a standalone, it's bad, but comparing it to its predecessor makes it worse. Bori Khan is bland, but putting him as a replacement to Shan Yu is an insult. Xianniang the Witch is a badly-developed character that just almost becomes interesting.

2020-09-07 00:00:00,"From some of the worst remake from Disney in the recent years with ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"", I wasn't really expecting much with ""Mulan"" as well. However, all I could say after watching the movie, that I am quite pleasantly surprised with the finished product.Sure there are some contrive moments with how the plot developed, especially towards the end when Mulan single handedly defected the enemy to save hundreds of soldiers and how she again single handedly rescued the Emperor from the evil Bori Khan. I just feel that the ending parts were a bit rush, without much of a proper lead up to how she got there.Nevertheless, there is definitely heart and soul in this movie with the main characters development (unlike the last few Disney remake movies, which is really a whole pile of mess, relying plainly too much on just the CGI & special effects). Mulan played by Liu YiFei is definitely the right choice for the role. She plays the main protagonist with enough restraints and yet at the same time, as a viewer, one could tell that there is a lot of internal dialogues and turmoil going on in her life (especially with the choices and decisions that she has had made along the way, to lead her to where her final success is being brought about). Even the evil witch role played by Gong Li has her own peaks and valleys in the character, narrating her own story in her own way. She is just not a clear cut evil person, but just someone trying to live her own mark as a women living among the men in a Man's World. As much as she was the evil witch in the movie, I can totally see her be acceptable and probably be label more of a gifted new age psychic in today's modern context. It is clearly shown in the movie that Mulan is the new wave of leading female role, taking over the destiny of her own life, as compared to her predecessors in which this case, the evil witch or even her own mother have had failed in the past.As someone coming from an Asian Chinese background, I can definitely relate to how the whole filial piety means to one's family growing up and in this case also the entire country as such. Obviously the world has changed in leaps and bounds, in terms of some of the older fashioned ways of thinking that the female is of a weaker sex. As such, I can truly see that this new 2020 rendition is especially catered to a new generation of female growing up in today's modern world. On the side note too, this movie is directed by a female director and that certainly helps to bring the narrative across too. Somehow, after having seen quite a few movies, being directed by female directors, there is just some extra ""je ne sais quoi"" elements in their movies that most male directors just fail to bring.",NEGATIVE,0.8005032539367676

I know it's Disney, so I shouldn't expected it, but I think the film would had been a success if they had decided to make the film a full-blown action drama film. It would have opened many new opportunities for Disney.Moreover, sometimes I felt like I was watching one scene and then it suddenly skipped to the other scene. The film is a bit too fast-paced. The filmmakers could had given a little more time to develop its characters, so viewers could feel for them.As for the casts, I think they casted the right people, but somehow, everyone seem so emotionless in the film. It was a waste of talent. As for the lead, Liu Yifei was great as Mulan. I don't care about her political view, but as an actress, I think she is fitted for the role. As Mulan, she is stunningly beautiful and fights like a warrior.Overall, the film is not bad, but it's not great either. A new team of screenwriter would improve the film a lot.",NEGATIVE,0.9895913600921632
2020-09-07 00:00:00,"I needed to watch the original version right after, just to rinse off the bitterness left in my mouth. In this movie, Mulan is born with a little somethin' somethin' that she had to keep hidden from the rest of her family because you know - patriarchy. Once she realized she should release her inner goddess - things get done. No heroes journey, no effort made to acquire skills needed for battle - nothing.
I can ignore the lack of charisma in almost all characters and a lot of pathetic humorless scenes but...
In the original version, Mulan was a confused awkward child that used her smarts and worked really hard to deserve the position and respect in the army. New Mulan was born with it. The cartoon depicts a true battle for equality girls like me needed while growing up while the new movie reruns the same idea from Disney's Star Wars - entitled protagonist.
""Make a man out of you"" is maybe the most inspiring song I ever heard, it can give me the energy to start learning for the hardest exam, start boxing, go to war, build myself a house, become an astronaut...

Something that happened to me in my life, I always wanted to make my grandparents proud and do what I wanted, just like Mulan...

This is some of the worst writing I've ever seen in a cinema history, I hope the writers never pick up a pen again. The dialogue is so cringeworthy and just flat out embarrassing, at times I honestly thought I was watching a chinese film dubbed in english. As for the storyline, it's pure garbage. Everything you loved about the original Mulan, this film completely ignores; Mushu isn't in it, the cricket isn't in it, the three funny friends Mulan has aren't in it and most importantly Shang-Li isn't in it. The fighting scenes are so mediocre that it's sad to watch, I can't get over the fact that they had a 200 million dollar budget for this movie when the cgi in this looks like something from a 2000s chinese tv drama. There is absolutely nothing good about this movie, the only reason I'm giving this a 2 is because I had some good laughs on how bad the dialogue was. The new storyline is filled with so many plot holes that you just yell out WTF every 15 minutes, so many things make no sense, even the costumes look pretty bad at times. The lead actress shows no emotion at all, she has no idea how to act. Maybe Disney thought her status in China would make this movie more successful, but in that case they should've gotten a Chinese actress who can actually show facial expressions. I have a pretty good idea of why Disney decided to make this movie the way this is, it's clearly suppose to be catered towards Chinese audiences, but even all the cultural pride can't overshadow how bad of a movie this is. If you we're planning on boycotting this movie because of politics, you can now also boycott it for being a disgrace to cinema and writing.

Her struggle to become accepted by her peers and captain was clear, it made her achievement believable and joyful.However, in the remake this doesn't happen, there is no struggle for Mulan, she already knows she is the best warrior, the only struggle is her deception at not showing it and this for me was a mistake by Disney.",POSITIVE,0.9762945771217346

I personally find it insulting when movie makers do this.Story's pace is like watching turtles in a marathon run. It starts good and then goes on a never ending tale of building up the story and then the actual interesting parts take maybe less than 20% of the movie. I easily got disconnected multiple times during the movie because of this.Somehow it felt like the movie's attempt to touch on traditions and martial arts aspect of the story was very cliche and from the perspective of someone without any proper knowledge who is only aware of the words not the meaning behind them.The actors were good and it was great to see so many old school actors joining together in a movie but the choices made for the story's pace and direction ruined it all.Next time, dont ever consider dubbing Jet li and bring on a director with cultural and martial art background to at least act as an assistant.It is a shame that a cartoon made 20+ years ago with less budget and technology is still 100x times better than a movie with far bigger budgets and more well known actors.",NEGATIVE,0.9991821646690368

+ Why they even replace Mushu with that witch, the witch make no sense at all. The witch is just a stupid object to point Mulan where to go to the next plot point.

Every time the characters accomplished the conflicts, the Phoenix shows up and 'whisper' to Mulan to tell her what she should be doing next, it feels like Mulan as the main character has no solid purpose for herself other than to protect her father and family. The story feels forced as there's not enough strong motives to drive the characters fight for something other than to save the Emperor at the end. Side characters have no big role to Mulan nor to drive the story or to put the stake higher, they're simply thrown in as emotional support to Mulan (she's still bland though) and as clown character (which miserably failed too, sorry Cricket), almost feel like the bonding between them is awkwardly forced, they're just stuck with each other and has to work together as a team under the reason of same purpose, plus they're the only remaining armies. Lack of characters development is the second big hole. Mulan's father is too good (too wise and too perfect) to be true as the Chinese is pretty patriarchal, it feels like he has no flaws other than his leg injury from previous war. Mulan herself as main character is stoic and reactive to the situation, not entirely sure she knows what she's doing, she just reacts on spot.

I actually enjoyed the concept of Chi, being a star wars fan. BUT using Chi to turn into animals and having claws for hands was just too ridiculous. And why is it that only the witch could transform?

I'm sad to see Mushu and Cricket go, but I'm also happy that the movie faces more realistic aspects of the original tale, where Women in Ancient Asia were disregarded as wives and daughters. How Mulan defied those original traditions of our culture has always been the core of the story, and I believe that this movie brings it justice.

Plot is a mess.

Why would the commander of an army agree to Mulan's request anyway and even lead that team back to the capital city? Abandoning your post is probably punishable by death and they had no reason to trust her.
Costume and architecture is a horrible, I can't believe the lead costume designer can say they're honest with their work in a straight face on camera and this is the work of studying with material from Europe and 3 months in China. Traditional costuming enthusiasts does better than this. I don't mind if they're not accurate.

I see a lot of complaints from unhappy folks who wanted a remake not a reimagining. If that's what you're expecting, skip this version and pop on the cartoon.
This reimagining is not fast paced. Far more methodical and pretty much all drama with little comic relief. Reminded me more of watching old war movies, which is pretty spot on for Mulan-a film about a female warrior. I am fine with the change in love interest, far more practical to find love with an equal instead of a commanding officer. The action sequences are more in line with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, etc. Aligned with Chinese cinema so that makes sense too.
I've read a lot of complaints about characters not getting much development through the movie-reminder this is called Mulan. Hint hint, wink wink-it is about her development. So again made sense while I was watching.
Favorites: the scenery. Breath taking, beautiful landscapes.
Less favorite-as a war story about Mulan there is no way I'd let my young nieces and nephews watch this. There's a reason it's PG-13.

Family and and tradition are everything to Asians. There was almost nothing Asian about the first two movies, and that's why many people don't get this movie. I've seen it twice and got emotional each time. Perhaps it's because I'm half Asian. I get both cultures and enjoy the differences.Most negative reviews I have read here lament that this is too Asian. They want a live musical version of the cartoon. This has nothing to do with the cartoon. It's a unique movie that delivers on both drama and action. There is subtlety in the performances and power in the action. There is no way this is a 1 star movie. I just don't think audiences are not comfortable seeing an all Asian cast that is not full of stereotypes.There is also criticism of the witch character. I found her to be one of the most compelling characters. She is a metaphor for all women that have been rejected for being strong. Her story is one of breaking rules, showing strength and finally of redemption.This is an important film on multiple levels, and I may watch it a third time which is something I never do.",POSITIVE,0.9955541491508484

2020-09-07 00:00:00,"Before I paid Disney $35(CAD), I'd watched/read lots reviews on it, I was kind of prepared and also got disappointed like others. The main weaknesses are:
The story is kind of rush. Mulan is not a regular girl, instead a kind of martial art genies. No smooth transition of Mulan's inner change from hiding herself to completely expressing the true her. The fighting actions sometimes look funny.
But when I watch it the second time, I actually noticed lots of details I missed the first time. The director and screenwriter actually made efforts to make the story complete, just some of the key lines are not emphasized so that they are easily neglected. And although a live version, it is still a fairy tale, a legend, not some realistic heroic action movie. We should not see it the same way as we see Brave Heart. You can clearly see this for the fact that there is not even one drop of blood on any dead soldiers' body. The main weak point is actually the performance of the leading actress, she could have had more facial expression to express more inner emotion. BTW, the character of the hawk is very crucial to the whole story, she represents the class of women who are crushed in a men's world and crave to make a change and meanwhile feel so hopeless. Millions of women like her fight in their own way for equal rights, it's their scarifies that pave the way to success for a small number of wonderful women like Mulan.

It's a good movie, it's different from the animated classic that's why I liked it. A lot of people are saying that they hate it for changing so much. That's the reason for the remake. I don't want another movie where the scenes and also how we knew Mulan is the same as the animated movie. The story is the same but there are added parts that I really like and I think was really interesting. Although I agree that it's kinda like star wars where the chi is the force. That's okay, it gives more chinese culture to it. That doesn't mean she's not using her intelligence and determination. She is still using it, but the chi helps her to be more stronger. It is still a fantasy, but for me it's good. I'm not degrading women, but women are often not as strong as men so it would be very weird if she's really that strong than other men. Even if she was trained when she was a child or training by herself alone she maybe strong but not as stronger as a men. So that's why it made sense adding the chi. The story is really good. But I wished when training the ""I'll make the man out of you"" music is better and nostalgic. It's okay for the movie to not be musical but on scenes like that at least the musical score of the animated songs would be great! They added the music when she was preparing for the matchmaking but did not added the ""I'll make the man out of you"" score. And also there are some scenes that a little gappy. Like when she encountered the witch, and when she went back to the war, I think they should add more scenes of how did she got there and also when she was shooting arrows at the enemy behind them, how did she got there?Mulan is it's own movie. I really liked it but still it's not perfect. For those who are comparing it too much from the animated classic I disagree with them. I watched other reviews saying that they got bored? At the beginning I never got bored. I was very entertained while observing the movie. I can see it's pros and cons. But I don't think it's a bad movie. I was not disappointed. The only disappointment for me was Beauty and the Beast and I watched it on cinemas. THAT I fell asleep and it's because it's the same, scene by scene for most of the part.Watch it and if you don't like it. That's okay. We all have our own preferences.

2020-09-07 00:00:00,"I first want to say I did not at all agree with the price tag Disney put on this movie, but because I've been waiting for it for so long I'm definitely glad I watched it. But $30 is a lot when I usually don't spend more than $10-15 for a movie in theaters, that's with the theater experience. A movie in the comfort of my home should be a lot less. That being said let's jump right into it.In the beginning of the movie, I feared that the acting would be subpar this is only because the young girl they chose to act as young Mulan felt like she was missing the level or professionalism that was expected of her. And the characters around her seemed to gravitate at first to this level set by young Mulan. This changed with a much older Mulan and the main actress who delivered her role absolutely amazingly.Mulan is a tale females need more than ever right now. For thousands of years men told women to be invisible, but some of the most courageous and smartest humans to help change the tides of history were women. It's funny how this message of a female ""knowing her place"" in the 21st century is still prevalent. It's really eye opening that it's 2020, almost 2021, and society still thinks in this old outdated way. I love the story of Mulan, animated version, but bringing it to life can really help broaden a young girl's horizons. For an adult woman, like myself, it makes me feel comfort and solstice through watching this movie. That I chose the right path for myself instead of listening to what society told me to do and expected me to do.Beyond that, seeing Mulan as a child being a tomboy running around being sporty and then being told girls aren't like that to know her place I felt that. I felt that on a deep level. My mom used to say that demeaning stuff to me all the time as a child and while I was growing up. It's like why would you try to make me into something I'm not? Or try to tell me to be a certain way because society doesn't except lively women? Not all women have to be princesses. Some females are destined to be warriors.I love the fact they replaced Mushuu with a phoenix. Since Mulan's story is all about being true to herself and her identity, growing into her skin, accepting herself as she is, being confident in that. It really suits the movie that not only was she solely able to see the Phoenix as her sign or symbol from a higher deity that she's in the right place at the right time in her life. That this choice is meant to be, but also the three virtues of loyal, brave, and true help her grow into that. Realize who she is and the game changes. It's absolutely an empowering feeling!The running up the walls was a bit much, but really I'll let it slide because some people do similar stuff with parkour. The journey of self was just stunning I can't say that enough. The Phoenix is a symbol of identity. Loyal, brave, and true,I usually cannot sit still through any movie for that matter, but I sat through this long one no problem at all. The only thing I paused for was to capture my feelings in the moment what I was feeling. I have a deep appreciation for this film.",NEGATIVE,0.5352017879486084

2020-09-07 00:00:00,"It's hard to remake something that's already good, and that's on Disney's current agenda as it looks to want to remake all of its animated films into a live-action film, with Mulan being the last film and not likely the last to be remade.But Mulan succeeded. At least I can say it's more satisfying than some of Disney's latest remake films such as Dumbo and The Lion King, which both came out last year. With her beautiful visuals, hard-hitting actions and a story that still hits the mark even though it's not as strong as the animation, Mulan is successful.The story is not that different from the animation. Hua Mulan (Liu Yifei) is a woman who since her childhood (played by Crystal Rao when she was a child) is very active and often runs here and there, chasing a chicken up to the roof and breaking things around which annoys her village residents. and embarrassed her family because in those days a woman's only duty was to ""be quiet. Quiet. Graceful. Elegant. Polite.""Until one day when the Rounan tribe led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) and his companion who was a magician Xian Lang (Gong Li) invaded China. The Emperor (Jet Li) issued a decree requiring each family to include one male family member in the military and help withstand attacks from the Rounan Tribe.This is where the dilemma for Mulan begins. In her family only her father, Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma), was eligible. Her entire family consists of women, including her mother (Rosalind Chao) and younger sister (Xana Tang). But his father, a veteran, is now in a condition not fit for war, with one leg that cannot move freely and requires a cane to stand or walk.Mulan, knowing her father's condition did not allow her to join the war, sneaked out of her house at night, took her father's sword and armor, took a horse and left the house to disguise herself as a man and enlist in the army so that her father didn't need to register.With Mulan, director Niki Caro tries to stick to the heart of the story with his animated film version but also wants to make Mulan something new. That way he eliminates the musical element in this film. No longer do we hear the song ""Ill Make a Man Out of You"" when Mulan is practicing.Now Mulan is focusing more on every fighting action that I can say is quite exciting for a Disney film. Indeed there is no blood because this is a family film, even though the sword has pierced the chest or cut the neck, every choreography and every clank of the sword moves so smoothly and well that it makes every war action in the film quite grumpy.The film is also quite a sight to behold, with its grand royal exterior decor and colorful village interior. And also with the clothes of each character, from the clothes of the soldiers that look luxurious and also handsome, the clothes of the dark and intimidating Rounan warriors, to Mulan's own simple yet elegant clothes with dominant red. If these films are aimed at feasting on the eye, then I can gracefully say they did!But I felt an oddity in Mulan and it was the comedy element that was really off. No longer does the film feel as cheerful as its predecessor's animation. The atmosphere of the entire film feels really serious and dark, although there are a few times the characters try to crack jokes that seem half-baked.And that's what is lacking from this live-action film, because if we remember Mulan's animation, we know that the 1998 film managed to combine quite serious seriousness (such as the status of a woman who only acts as a male supporter) and comedy that makes the film feel light. and fun. Not with this film.But Mulan still managed to bring up a tough theme, touching on the topic that women can do what men can do, even better. And if these films were made with the aim of having a more serious tone, then they did. We will no longer sing along with the characters in it, but will be amazed at every jump, every slash and every run-on the wall which is certainly really fun.",POSITIVE,0.9960094094276428

the action is great, the characters are beautiful and all the actors fit so well. olden china wasn't this colourful but what's a Disney movie without colour. the sets are amazing. the cinematography is beautiful. the acting is laudable- liu yifei did an amazing job.
The khan's character missed some depth. If they could add the witch they could add Mushu. though i love this version- i don't love it more than mushu. there could've be an addition of wit and humor but i am not complaining.

I only watched it for the first time a couple of years ago, and I really enjoyed it but not quite on the level that a lot of people seem to.That's why I have a feeling I'll be in the minority when I say that I actually preferred the live action remake of Mulan over the original. There aren't any songs, and Mushu isn't in the film, but that didn't bother me in the slightest. In fact, considering the tone and the atmosphere that they went with, I'm glad they weren't in the film.The best part about this version of Mulan is the cinematography. It's a visually stunning film, with beautiful colours and gorgeous scenery. Almost every shot was framed in such a way that would make it a really nice poster, and that's rare for a film nowadays.The narrative was constantly compelling and I loved the gritty samurai elements. The action was well choreographed, if a little choppy at times. Another major pro was the musical score, as it added so much drama to scenes which were already exciting.The screenplay was brilliantly written for the most part, but my main criticisms with the film lies within the minimal development for the villain and the little training that we saW Mulan go through. There were also some scenes that I felt could have been shortened, allowing room for the plot elements that I just mentioned.Overall, whilst it's clear from the reviews that a lot of audience members are not happy with this iteration of Mulan, I had a thoroughly good time with it and I can see myself rewatching this film instead the original which isn't something I say very often.

That being said, this is a good action flick (minus the Disney musical soundtrack), with great effects & lots of action!
Mulan is a girl, born to a father who wanted a son. When barbarians attack the Chinese empire, the Emperor issues an order for every family to send one male, Mulan steals her aging father's armor & sword, and goes in his place.she has to hide her true talent for fighting because she is a girl, but eventually saves her entire battalion, and goes on to save the empire, gaining the Emperor's respect and gratitude.",POSITIVE,0.9995535612106324

The REASON for most of the negative reviews here.Now onto the things that I liked about this movie. Mulan's relationship with his father has improved. She doesn't need much help from the ancestors (thus the absence of Mushu and his replacement by a phoenix). One of the villains has actually a great fair reason behind her actions. It is more faithful to the source material and with it being a live action movie, it is more epic and is more masterful on the fight sequences.The actors in this movie did a great job, however the best acting goes to Gong Li's Xianniang. The villain that I was talking about. She and Mulan share similarities. They're both women and they use their chi, and it is forbidden in their China that a woman wields chi. The only difference between the two is that Mulan is accepted by her father, her comrades, and her commander. Xianniang was banished from her village, and Bori Khan, the other villain who looks like Shan Yu from the animated film, found her, and saw her as an opportunity to lead his army to success. Mulan asked Xianniang for help in finding the emperor. She told her that it is not too late to do goodness, and Xianniang was able to redeem herself, she was able to take the noble path for a while, before sacrificing herself to save Mulan.Now the bad stuff, this movie doesn't try to be much more creative. Although it is closer to the source material, I think that they could've improve more. Mulan's training wasn't improved. It's still the same. There's also the lack of compelling characters, with the exception of Mulan and Xianniang. It isn't as memorable as the original one.Overall, the movie is pretty decent. I enjoyed watching it. And about to Liu's message about the HK protests, watching this movie doesn't make you against human rights. It doesn't make you a supporter of the CCP. Watch this with your political views set aside.",POSITIVE,0.9614431858062744

2020-09-06 00:00:00,"Mulan has arrived, not at cinemas as originally planned but instead as the first film in what will likely become a library of Premier Subscription titles. As the latest live action remake of an animated classic this will naturally draw comparisons with the 1998 original Disney movie.
If you're looking for nostalgia, songs and animal sidekicks then go for the 1998 version. If you're looking for a more adult offering with battles and a discussion of duty and sacrifice then the 2009 version is for you.
This Mulan is a story about embracing yourself, it's full of subtle and not so subtle imagery and honours the story of Mulan while also providing a film that isn't just a rehash of the animated original.
There is still stylised choreography, excellent wire work and great set pieces as the Chinese army take on the Rouran. Mulan, the brave daughter of Zhou, takes her father's place in the army to save his life. She wrestles with hiding her true identity as she trains to help save China.
This story is about two women, Mulan and the witch Xianniang, both women having been forced to hide who they truly are. Xianniang allowed it to torment her, driving her to seek validation with the armies of Borï Khan who dislike and distrust her as much as the Chinese but see her as a useful weapon. Mulan refuses to accept this fate and instead risks everything to embrace her true self, understanding that it will enable her to unlock her full potential but also doom her to dishonour and possible death as she seeks to save China.
Mulan is protected and guided by the Phoenix, a powerful Chinese symbol of grace, virtue, balance and harmony. The bird guides her through to her acceptance of her true self and symbolically follows her when she accepts her destiny.
It's a wonderful film and an empowering interpretation of the story for young girls. The action scenes are exciting but not graphic and the performances are great. There are also some lovely nods to the original such as the character Cricket, one of the soldiers Mulan meets.
Yifei Liu is excellent as Mulan and the film is certainly enhanced by her doing the majority of her own stunts. Donnie Yen gives a powerful performance as Commander Tung, Tzi Ma and Rosalind Chao are wonderful as Mulan's parents and both Jason Scott Lee and Li Gong are solid villains.
There is great rewatch value in this film and I'm sure repeat viewings will reveal more subtleties. In my opinion it is the second best Disney live action after Jungle Book and well worth the money for the Premium Subscription.",POSITIVE,0.99787700176239

People don't like the actress, Liu Yifei because some politicals controversities but chill up she is just playing a characters in here. Some people don't like it because of Mushu who is missing or the songs from the original. But this is not only a live action adaptation, it is also bassed on the ""Ballad of Hua Mulan"".
I loved everything about this film. It is very colorful and so beautiful to see , nice characters from the originals are in here and new ones added. It's visually stunning!I liked the new version of Mulan - she wants to take her father's place in the war that threatens the kingdom and she does so. She was trained to fight, and she wants to bring honor to the family.
She is a bold character, optimistic and confidant.
She takes great advices from the witch.The witch is a powerful character added to the new story of mulan. She isn't really bad, she just want to integrate and was exilated her whole life. She gives me ""Snow White and the Huntsman "" vibes.Bori Khan - he is the villain to the new movie and a new version of Shan Yu. He wants to take down the emperor and rule China and he wants revenge of his father death.Honghui - it's Mulan's love interest of this film. They have a huge connection but they don't kiss or stay together in this film. He is replacement to Li Shang and it's a cool character. He helps both Mulan and Hua Jun. And it's very friendly.I loved the script, it was different from the animation. But it kept some originals scenes like the matchmaker scene or the snow avalanche. I liked that in this version Cricket was mentioned as a human character and in this movie, Mulan's grandpa is replaced by her sister. I didn't quit like the fact that grandpa was missing but i liked it anyway. The songs from the animations are played in the background and there is a lot of actions in the last half of the film. I liked the relation between Mulan and her father. And i liked the misterious Phoenix who is showing around Mulan in time to time.I really hope they make a sequel to this because i want to see more of this beautiful movie, and more of this characters or about the phoenix.

People won't be turning their back on someone in the first min to trusting and letting them lead on the next one just because she went there to provide the inside information. This is not how human mind works. The animation is well liked because it works as a story, and this film failed because the story failed, not because it's not the animation version.

2020-09-06 00:00:00,"This is not the Disney cartoon - it's more mature, and yet walks the fine line of retaining enough of the innocence from the first iteration that it is appropriate enough for children to watch while shedding itself of the light-heartedness that made it childish. The plot remains nearly identical, with some slight shifts that better accommodate live-action. While some critics malign the special effects of the film, they neglect the historical nods to Chinese fantastical martial arts films, like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, the Ip Man series, Fearless, and countless others. The effects are intended to separate the film from reality, as a war movie based in realism is completely inappropriate for children. Despite the overly PC PG-13 rating for violence and coming of age themes, the film almost never shows any blood, and Mulan coming of age is gently insinuated rather than uncomfortably forced down your throat. Compared to other Disney re-make efforts, it is less frightening than the Lion King by a long shot and on par with Aladdin in execution (minus the cheese-y music).

It suits a life action better than some other story's but it's been done poorly.First of all I'm happy to see it's not an direct copy of the animation in terms of story. It's starts somewhat on the same foot but takes a little detour along the way introducing a Little magic and taking some away. This is all good and well if it was for the better but that's where they get lost. The characters are poorly developed especially the main characters. They stay somewhat the same the whole movie except they gain some skills but they are not grown in personality. Mulan grows a bit in the beginning but doesn't gain any skills (she already has them). This makes the story some what plain.So the story is mediocre but serves the purpose of telling about Mulan, the story we already know. Therefor I'd expected to be a visual masterpiece, and it is if it wasn't for the special effects .The scenes are well lit and styled, the outfits are amazing and beautiful to see. The scenery feels less recognizable but is stunning. It's less China and more Silk Road. But then there are the visual effects: they look cheap and uncontrolled. It's like they put form over function. The visuals do not serve the story, the story is just to drive the movie from scene to scene so they can show new stuff.If you're a Mulan fan or a movie fan in general, skip this one.

Ok I have never seen the animated film but, if its anything like this it will be fab.

Its beautifully filmed, amazing effects and absolutely flawless CGI. I think the people these days are really spoilt with films and because of remakes find it very easy to criticise something because they are expecting what they know.... Don't!!!!!
Watch the film as the film it is, its incredibly entertaining, despite my gripes about it not really being for children.... If thats what peoples problem is, say that, don't just have a go a criticise because you thought it was something else!!!I really have liked all the remakes that Disney have done, the Lion King, Dumbo, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast etc.... I thought they were all amazing. But if people want to be stuck into the old films and slate new ""real' versions of films, then I think you are very sad. Its not like they've not been done in fabulous Disney style with no expense spared, some people are just stuck in the past.So, I highly recommend this film, It definitely isn't for little ones.... I am going to have to watch the original animated one to see how they got away with all the war and fighting in that.... Surely thats part of the story????

The action scenes are way to goofy and unrealistic to enjoy, the comedy falls flat every single time, and the cuts are awkward and make the movie hard to watch. The most iconic song from the original movie was ""I'll make a man out of you,"" but when they deliver that line and head into montage in the remake, the song doesn't play.

It made women the Center of the plot for the good side and the bad side and it didn't make the story about how a woman needs a man. She came of age and chose her own path. Wonderful job! You simply can't compare it to the original- it's not the same movie. Mulan was always my favourite Disney movie and this one did not disappoint.

When I learned that this movie would take a different direction I was kinda excited hoping to see a different movie with the same main theme that will exceed my expectations and I was wrong. This movie excells in cinematography and fighting choreographies were pretty good, also some actors did their job good enough. But beyond that, this movie has nothing else, the plot is stupid and simplified, they didn't even try to make her look like a boy, the humour was terrible, and the dialogue felt wooden and written by a comitee to create a feminist symbol with the worst possible way.

untouchable, but that doesn't mean that this new movie doesn't deserve to have its own moment. In my opinion, Disney will never nail the live action movies until they decide to either go a completely different route from the original or go on to make a carbon copy of the original. With this movie they also tried (like before) to make a mix, but that doesn't work. The scenes that were reminiscent of the original felt out of place and forced. But the brand new scenes and story lines where refreshing and I enjoyed them. Also the fighting scenes were exciting and the actors did a good job.
Also, for me, the story of Mulan can be either a complete children's movie or an epic and mature film for adults. This in-between-movie was nice but the story just has so much more potential and I feel like it got restricted by Disney.",NEGATIVE,0.8183854818344116

But I have to say after seeing this movie I actually really enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to. Mulan(2020) isn't the best Disney live action movie but it is one of the better ones, no it doesn't reach the same heights as say beauty and the beast or Aladdin but it's a lot better than say lion king. The cast in this movie for example is amazing each member delivers a great performance but the man standout is Li gong who steals the show each time she is on screen. The music also is great yes there is no singing in the movie but the score is really good. The characters are also great yes there's the same characters but there is a couple new characters that were a welcome edition to the story. The story is also very unique because it's own thing and not a shot for shot remake of the animated Mulan. The action in this movie also is fantastic there was people running on walls flipping and stuff like that. Where the movie starts to fail Is with the changes, yes some worked but that's very little there was a constant feeling I had of something is missing.

A lot of essential characters where excluded but the core of the story is still the same.

Liu Yifei gave the character its right but I guess it would have been better if they kept Mulan's character as it was meant to, fun and enthusiastic.

One of my favorite parts in the original was when she bowed down and presented the sword and medal to her father.

My seven year old watched it with me and loved it and would have given it a ten. He didn't go in with any expectations. He walked away understanding the message of the story and that women can be powerful heroes and earn respect and position for their accomplishments, and with some insight and appreciation for Chinese history and virtues.

In this movie, she is from a very poor family in a Hakka fort! This fort is too new to be even in the Mulan old ancient story. Hakka forts are not even anywhere old enough to match the time difference. Then in this home part of the story, there were so many lousily made stories.
How can 12 men soldiers conquer a city fort? The director thought city armies only consist of a few soldiers? These directors don't even know what they were doing!
Even when the 12 gang enemy re-routed, it was nonsense to chase in that direction where home soldiers' bows and the enemy big troops are in the same places. Other big nonsenses were in the avalanche that Mulan is faster than a big avalanche and enemy is too foolish to change shooting at big armies but to shoot at a few soldiers with a cannon!
Many nonsenses jokes were shot at the palace too because no armies were missing guarding at the fort. These directors seemed never seen any China palace walls because they do not know the walls are also pathways!
I cannot give this movie a normal start because Disney is a very big movie maker with very big budgets.

And mind that Mulan still is one of my favourite cartoon movie, so thats quite something to achieve.Let me put it simple, every time the script diverged from the cartoon it was for the worst. They left out the best parts and added the most ridiculous nonsense you can imagine.
The Witch: Why add this character? How lazy do you have to be as a screenwriter to only be able to make the story ""work"" by adding a character that can morph into any other character? Betrayal? Complicated motives? Multilayered characters? No - it was just the witch who took over the Kings servant.The Phoenix: Absolutely useless trope. I would argue that the story of Mushu in the cartoon was written better that the whole Mulan 2020 script. This dumb phoenix from the ashes metaphor has been done a thousand times, please for gods sake can these people have one original idea?Loyal, brave, and true. These three words appear like 10 Times through the movie yet absolutely nothing comes from it that wouldn't naturally appear in a Mulan story. Its like making a Harry Potter movie and have the word ""Magic"" appear on every item. Yeah we know, it's a movie about bravery - we have all seen the cartoon.Scenery: The landscapes are beautiful, if this would be a documentary. Did anyone tell the director that the landscapes in a movie need to make sense? I felt like I'm watching an old spice comercial: I'm on top of a mountain, now I'm in the desert, look back to me I am now inside a vulcano.In Summary the movie had three very strong virtues.

Even the anime got it right better than this one.Mulan character and strength development progress doesn't feel continuous. And the sudden twist in the middle and the ending is confusing. Dialogues are very weak.It's very surprising. Disney has some excellent story telling capability and some of the best stories in animated why they real life always fall short?

2020-09-06 00:00:00,"This movie was ok one time watch unlike the original which I watched over and over again in my teens around 20 years ago. I wouldn't be able to sit through the new one beyond this first viewing. I didn't like the over emphesis on feminism aspect. I thought it was OTT. The original film just made it look effortless it wasn't even about that it was just a girl that wanted to save her father. She didn't want to be soldier she just wanted to save her father and in order to do that she became soldier. Where as this film was totally opposite..this film lacked depth, also Mulan in the original had beautiful, funny, out of the box personality which is why she was different to the rest of the women and that is why she struggled to find her place. This Mulan just seemed too serious her personality was boring, and it was only her talent in chi that made her out of place not her personality. The film lacks the joyful journey, the humour, the team work, and companionship that was in the original.

Yifei as Mulan is also excellent, I have my doubt before watching this film, but she really did pull her weight, her acting as a man is quite convincing I would say. Donnie Yen, Jet Li and Gong Li also did very well and really carry the scene.This movie is also quite heavy on depicting Chinese culture which is great, but often done without any explaination which could be confusing, e.g. the use of Phoenix and the use of Chinese character Xiao has a certain meaning in Chinese, but probably will be lost in translation to many people without understanding Chinese culture.

2020-09-06 00:00:00,The movie is incredible. I enjoyed every bit of it. And I hated how someone like Mulan was judged by her sex not by her worth. It is not new to us that we had a very long history of oppression based on male hierarchy that had no foundation but fear and the need to control. I'm a man and I hate it. A lot of people seems to compare this with the animation but do no get stuck with the past. It's better to move on and see how this movie brings a beautiful story in a very complex settings that is the Chinese culture. I really loved this one better than The Lion King and Beauty and The Beast. They took a risk on something new and in my opinion succeeded.

Really, I don't care about the absence of Mushu or Shang. I think it's a good idea to follow the original story. I like the concept. BUT, I don't think it was well executed. I really expected Mulan to be an action movie and weighs on the fight scenes but it was so shallow. I still expected some musical, I mean they could add it. They could've made the training scene have more depth and sweat. Make it harsher and repeated because it makes more sense, it's the emperor army anyway. Could've made it musical in that part too. The battle scene is so shallow too.. I just think it could've been a lot better. I'm disappointed tbh, not because it's not as fun as 1998 Mulan, but because it was just shallow.

While watching it, I tried to enjoy and find good things on this movie but can't help to say these words too many times: ""why disney, why you ruin your own masterpiece"". ""Oh my God why"".The movie lacks of many aspects:
1. no heartful emotions between the characters (for example Mulan and his dad - lack of heartwarming father daughter moment; Mulan and her friends - they only mentioned the names but no memorable events with them, oh I missed their moments; Mulan and ""new"" Li Shang - LOL they replaced Li Shang with this guy but their relationship= Zero spark);
2. unnecessary new characters (and after finished watching I don't even remember who's who)
3. super horrible special effects (I can't believe it, again, ""why disney?"")
4. the battle was not grand and not memorable at all.
5. the actress is beautiful but no emotions stand out. I'm sorry but it was so plain and boring to watch her.
6. extreme shift key-point of the story.Such a terrible movie.It's just a standard plain martial arts movie, but they branded it as MULAN. Lol thanks a lot disney.Overall.

2020-09-06 00:00:00,"I was reading all these negative reviews before watching, so I went into it with low expectations.
About my Disney remake experience so far: watched original Aladdin as a kid, and I still find it incredible, with great script and amazing soundtrack; on the other hand I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes of the remake which was unimaginative, complete cringe, garbage renditions of the original songs, Smith's genie was a sort of a ghetto joke,.. To say the least, I found it to be the most cringe thing I've seen in a while.
When I saw they were remaking Mulan, I expected another uninspired money-grabbing cringefest from Disney, but instead we got teen oriented kungfu flick that stands far enough from the original not to feel uninspired but fresh, there were no musical scenes that are such a great part of Disney animations but turn cringe when done in live action movies (case in point- Aladdin 2019) and I commend the director for avoiding it. There is some renditioned soundtrack from the original Mulan in this movie, just a taste of it, that gives that sense of nostalgia to anyone that watched animation as a kid; I would have preferred more of the original soundtrack, I was especially interested to hear rendition of the song I'll make a man out of you, but I guess we're gonna have to wait for that until the next remake, which should be coming in next 10-15 years (because Disney, ofc).
There are a lot of things wrong with this movie if you care to look for it: plotholes, plot armor, some cringe moments, some problems with script dialogue at points and editing blunders, some cliche moments etc. that is if you look for it.But...if you're watching this for entertainment value, I think it's definitely the best Disney live-action remake so far, and great action and message far outweighs the cringe, which is something I thought I could never again say about a product of Disney.Definitely recommended.",NEGATIVE,0.7678869366645813

The phoenix is annoying and helpless and looks like a kite. There is no reason why they should keep that animal. There is nearly no fight scenes, only a few that make you sleepy.

2020-09-06 00:00:00,"Very sad to say this but I was honestly let down by this movie, maybe it was just because of having high expectations created by the animation but it did not live up to it.I really missed the songs and they left out so many characters whilst introducing new ones which didn't really have as much depth to contribute to the story.
Whilst watching it I was also thinking about the budget of the movie, which is something I have never done before haha. But it just felt that they were constrained and that's why they weren't able to really highlight some of those big scenes from the animation.
However, I did kind of look at Mulan in a different way- they really showed her struggle with not only leaving family, but also her guilt deceiving her comrades.
They also completely took out the romance- which ok, they're at war- but that was also a big part of her gaining the trust and respect of her platoon in my opinion - Li Shang was their captain after all. Dunno though, maybe they didn't want to portray a woman getting with her boss 🤷‍♀️
They also introduced this magical element through something they called chi (her inner strength essentially). I loved this one scene where her father is telling her to suppress her strength in order to become a good wife and mother for the future. But otherwise, this kind of just didn't develop that much from there.In general though, as a lot of reviews have already stated, I really felt that the movie relied on the nostalgia as well as the viewers prior knowledge of the animated version of this movie and can therefore not really stand on its own successfully.All in all, it felt like a weak attempt at making it resonate:
they should have expanded upon the traditional chinese culture more (This version has a sister - let her get married to some renowned guy so the pressure really is on mulan to get married - but I do not know why they I created a sister to begin with though),really show the general struggle within the war (in the animation Li's father dies leading another platoon against their enemies- really shows the effect of war - which this one kind of did as it showed the aftermath but with a distance as we did not know anyone who died from that scene)and maybe also a scene or repeated references to how men look at the way their society is constructed / their views on the opposite gender (as this IS a story about the differences between men and women).Nonetheless, I still love the girl power In this movie adaptation. The introduction of the witch really sets the undertone of how women who have strengths, are perceived to as something evil because women aren't supposed to step outside the kitchen door.Maybe I will rewatch but the animation is still #1 to me",NEGATIVE,0.9958738684654236

Mulan was clumsy and she didn't know she can fight well. Then they live in some sort of slums when Fa Family was quite popular in the original movie and had massive house, very disappointing with mushu missing and the songs. LIKE COME ON THERE IS NOT ONE SONG. And Mulan has a sister as we all know she had a little brother which was her dog but okay she got a sister. There is non one scene from the original movie at all.

Secondly, separate your enjoyment of the movie to your sentiments on the lead actress' political views.Once you view this movie in that context - it is a beautifully crafted movie that actually quite faithfully carries the themes from the Disney animated, albeit without talking dragons and dancing on the way to battles. Beautiful locations (New Zealand part of that hehe), amazing sets and costume designs that feel authentically Chinese yet also Disney-esque, and choreography that reflects the dramatised martial arts style of Chinese Kung Fu movies (ala Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). Director Niki Caro did a great job trying to bring in more Chinese elements into the movie than the cartoon did to build more authenticity (eg. incorporating concepts like 'chi') into the setting of that world.
View this as it's own movie, not compared to the animated film before it, and you will find a beautifully crafted movie which carries a timeless message.Enjoy!",POSITIVE,0.9997684359550476

2020-09-06 00:00:00,"Majority of watchers already know how the story goes. I felt something was just really missing throughout the entire movie. The lack of the soundtrack that made the original animation version so touching was a miss for sure. The Witch character by Gong Li was completely pointless. And I feel (like others have mentioned) that deeper character arcs were just really absent from the movie. We don't get to see Mulan's inner turmoil in taking her father's place, we don't see the realization from her father once he realizes the sacrifice his daughter made. The iconic hair-cutting scene was absent too. Early press interviews indictated that Mushu's absence was due to wanting Mulan's camaraderie with her fellow men to be the focus but I saw zero depth between her and the men; the only thing we get in the obvious attraction from Honghui, which was a lame replacement for the animated version's Shang Li. The final battle scene was so Hollywood and made me roll my eyes. Mulan's efforts in saving the entire palace of people was also incredibly underscored in this version. Just very anticlimactic. And random, and I don't know if this was on purpose or not, but Yifei Liu looked half asleep in nearly all the scenes of her out in the desert on the horse. She looked really tired. And I love how once she decides to be ""true"" to herself...she lets her hair down and returns to the battle field with a super-clean face that's considerably paler than how she appeared for the first half of the entire movie. Come on....I will say the set visuals overall were nice, but I've watched enough Chinese period dramas to know how massive and to-scale Hengdian Studios is with Chinese palaces and forts. So maybe impressive to others, but not super surprising to me. This movie reminded me a lot of the live-action ""Aladdin"" remake -- great visuals, but something is just missing story-wise. Many things cut from the animated version just take away from the belief of the live-action version.That all being said, I still think it was great for Disney to give Asian faces and Asian stars a chance to shine and represent a folktale known by generations.I'd say watch this if you're curious, but if you don't -- you're honestly not missing out on anything.",NEGATIVE,0.9993200898170472

This movie was always going to be in theaters first as a likely blockbuster then Blu-ray and digital ""then"" maybe a year later it would have ended up on Disney +.

Then I discovered that most user ratings were politically motivated, and nothing but anti-china bots, with nonsensical reasons to make this movie look bad. In that regard they failed their purpose, because its free publicity and it made me actually wanting to see the movie even more.After watching the movie myself, I can truly say it was beautifully made! The movie had good build up, majestically filmed. Yifei as Mulan was charismatic and her charms added depth to the character Mulan. She sometimes speaks volumes without saying anything, and when she does say something its meaningful, those are rare qualities of an actor.At times it gave me goosebumps to finally see a live action version of Mulan, I have to admit I had to wipe some occasional tears away throughout the movie.Mulans companions were funny and their camaraderie was heartfelt.Fun fact: Honghui was historically the love interest of Mulan, not Shang Li from the animated movie ;-)Even though without the musical songs that made the animated version popular, but there were enough references to the animation throughout the movie that made it satisfying watch and did honor to the animated version.All the actors were great and solid, especially the father played by Tzi Ma was convincing as a caring and inspirational father to Mulan in such a short timespan of character development.Sad fact: Historically Mulan fought a war campaign of 12 years. She never did get to see her father again, because when she got home her father already died of old age. Traumatized by warfare, Mulan never became her old self, she got depressed and committed suicide, hoping she could reunite with her father in the afterlife being that carefree loving daughter again....The encounter with the Witch (Xianniang) played by Gong Li was superbly done. I think the witch might even have been a metaphor for Mulans inner fears. It was so poetically well executed.I am glad Jetli got to do some of his last few action sequences, as Jetli is suffering from returning illnesses, the reason why he doesn't do much action nowadays.Bori Khans character is the equivalent of Shan Yu in the animated version, and is in the live action more fleshed out as to what his motivations were for attacking the kingdom, that was a nice touch.Also nice references to chinese Wuxia genre, where lifeforce and chi are prominent for martial art masters.For the people that missed Mushu, there is a reference of a phoenix though that helped Mulan, and in chinese folklore phoenix represents a woman.I recommend this movie highly for the fans of the original animation and for people who are new to the story of Mulan.For me it was a well worthy tribute to both the legendary chinese folklore story Mulan aswell as the original disney animated version!",POSITIVE,0.9842472076416016
2020-09-06 00:00:00,"Mulan is one of my favorite Disney animated films so I was ecstatic when I heard a live action remake was coming. I was so disappointed when it was pushed back due to a Covid-19. I finally forked out the $30 to see it through Disney plus and I regret to say, the live action film left very much to be desired. In my opinion, Disney made a tremendous mistake straying from the original animated story and eliminating the iconic songs and characters. I'm all for making a movie more historically accurate, but the movie appeared to attempt to take a more realistic approach which is one of the main aspects working against it. If they wanted a more serious and realistic approach, the storyline, acting and fight scenes needed to be stepped up significantly. The story of Mulan could have pulled off being written as an epic with large armies, further character development, a darker villain, increased action and intense fight scenes. But the live action attempt completely failed to make an epic action movie creating something boring and pretty bland. If they didn't want to push the envelope with more violence and maturity, they should have stuck with what worked for the animated version. The entire appeal of Disney is to bring ""magic"" and music. ""Make a Man Out of You"" is one of the best Disney songs of all time! Why they bothered adding the supernatural component of the witch and Phoenix and removing Mushu was beyond me. It would have been amazing to see him in cgi and he would have brought some much needed comic relief to the movie that would have made up for the lazy plot, boring scenes, underwhelming action scenes, and poor acting. I also found myself inserting where a song should have went during certain scenes of the movie. The character development was also extremely poor. Jet Li sounded robotic reciting his lines and for a second, I wondered if his speaking parts were voice overs. They significantly under utilized a strong martial arts actor there. The actress playing Mulan actually fit the role well, but they failed her with what she was given to work with. She came off like a jerk for risking her life and her family's honor just to prove a woman could do better than what a man could instead of coming off like a selfless girl trying to protect her ailing father. I don't entirely regret watching, but I wouldn't watch again. Definitely don't spend $30 on this. Wait to watch when it is added to Disney Plus's regular roster. Man, these live actions started out so promising with the great Jungle Book, good Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, but The Lion King and Mulan were mediocre, perhaps even downright bad.",NEGATIVE,0.9988046288490297

Only the jungle book deserved the remake in my opinion). It just need a better story scene and script.Also on the side note, it would be more interesting if they erase all this magical power and has Gong Li's character to be someone who used deceit and hidden tactics, pretending to be a witch for the fear factor instead of actually being this half bake chi witch.",NEGATIVE,0.9979419708251952

It's safe to say that this has fallen in the mid tier range. With an amazing cast no doubt about that, an amazing cinematography which is a pity because it isn't being shown on the big screen. ""There have been many tales of the great warrior Mulan.

And the actions are so cool, Very interested to see everyone's reaction when they see the movie at home or theatre.

Even it is a action movie but children can still see very happy.Compared to origianl Mulan. her femail identity is been found in the middle of the movie. But that is what I think the most excited moment for this whole movie. A femail so brave to show who she is, face her fear and save her friends. Even she may be killed by her identity but nothing can stop her.

2020-09-06 00:00:00,"This being my 3rd Mulan movie, not counting the sequel to the cartoon movie. So my review is based on a comparison between the cartoon Mulan movie and the Chinese live action MulanIf you liked the Disney cartoon of Mulan, you'll probably enjoy it. They even turned some of the song lyrics from the cartoon version into dialogue and rewrote some of the key combat sequences to make more sense in a live action movie. On the other hand, if you've seen the Chinese live action Mulan, then this will fall well short of the mark for you.They replaced the dragon with a bird which honestly, they could have done without. It's more complicated than just changing critters for kicks, but I'm trying not to give away the reason for using this particular bird... Thankfully, it was a very minor and limited plot device. Slightly more egregious though, is the addition of another unnecessary character to fulfil a similar role.The combat is VERY wuxian. So, if you liked the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Dragon Blade fight sequences then you'll enjoy the fight scenes in Mulan. Lots of gravity defying FX and altogether unbelievable fighting techniques. But hey! It's a fantasy movie set in ancient China, so the action is standard fare.I do have to give it props for being a great movie for kids, especially girls. That whole inspirational, ""you can overcome everything life throws at you"" theme comes out better than in the cartoon. I actually added a star just for this.My issue with this film is that even though it's live action, it still feels like the cartoon version of Mulan. It lacks the gritty realism of the Chinese Mulan and the pace is sort pretty quick. My impression is that corners were cut with the plot because it is essentially a remake that most people know. Every familiar scene seems a bit clipped. Even the combat scenes are relatively brief for a live-action action film. Character development is minimal except for Mulan herself. You almost need to rewatch the cartoon movie so you can understand some of the important characters and sub-plots.As for the cast.... and what a cast! Excellent performances all around! I have to say that the casting department did a top notch job.I'm giving this version of Mulan 7 stars. The writing and directing is just too lazy to warrant more stars even in spite of the excellent acting and special effects. Since it is largely based on the cartoon movie there just isn't enough new content to oooh and aaah over. I also realize that many people reading this have never seen the Chinese version of Mulan. So, if my rating seems a little low, then my recommendation is to go find the better, grittier Chinese version for context.",NEGATIVE,0.9622618556022644

The cinematography is beautiful, and there are some really nice panoramic shots. I originally planned to give this movie 1 star, but figured it should be at least 2 due to the production quality.Touches on the topic of female empowerment.That's it.The Bad:
The dialogue was extremely stilted and awkward to the point where I would notice it every few lines. I feel like the script also negatively affected the acting as well.There was a distinct lack of focus on Mulan's relationship with the other soldiers, and overall the movie lacked the same sort of warmth that was shown in the Disney animation. I didn't care about the characters at all.They completely skipped over the process of Mulan working hard to overcome the difficult training in the army. That should've been crucial to developing her character like it was in the animation, but instead the audience just gets shown a shot of her magically improving one day.No music from the original Disney animation, which is made even more disappointing by the lack of unique musical score. At times the instrumentals sounded more Indian and Middle Eastern than Chinese.Fight scenes were surprisingly boring and overdone, the choreography felt like something I've seen a million timesOverall the movie just felt bland and emotionless, and I didn't really care about any of the characters in the end.",NEGATIVE,0.9989559054374696

We grew up watching the Disney Mulan (1998) and most probably majority of the people are expecting something like a Live Action version of the Mulan (1998). Expecting to have the songs (like other disney movie) in the movie, the singing and funny scene from mushu and stuff. But no, this is not a live action of Mulan (1998). I would say, it is its own version of MULAN movie with same plot story as Mulan (1998). If you watch it without high expectation from Mulan (1998), then this Mulan (2020) actually isnt half bad. It was great actually and I enjoyed it. However, as a Disney Movie (any disney movie), I think that they should have include the singing and songs in the movie and not just the music (and only part of it).

I'm very confused about this movie in comparison of animated version. For me the best and emotional moment was she showed who really her was and left to fight to her nation. But the movie have some fails and the narration was so fast that didn't convince me and the actors didn't convey emotion in their roles although the film has its moments. Even so, the movie is visible but it is so far from suprassing the classic Mulan. The movie lacked emotion, love, romance and what we all expected, Mushu. But keep in mind that the director wanted to make a more realistic version of the animated one, even so, having played even more with the fantasy and the beautiful songs that existed in the classic version of Mulan would have been great, but I loved the melody of '' Reflection '' depicted in the movie.",POSITIVE,0.808719277381897

Also, the costume is a disaster. It feels odd to see all the colours they used in this movie. Not to mention those were not the colour used in ancient China. In ancient China, colours and patterns represent social ranking. It feels embarrassed to see the emperor in a costume more humble and poor than the others.
Last but definitely not least, the removal of the songs has decreased the strength of plot and characteristics. It won't be a problem if the songs or characters from the animation are removed. But it would be a problem when there is no replacement to emphasise the theme or the epiphany of the character.

2020-09-06 00:00:00,"This movie is not even good as a stand alone film. But as a remake, and comparing it to the original makes it that much worse. The original Mulan is one of my favorite movies and I waited so long for this movie to come out and was incredibly excited. What a disappointment! They took out everything good from the original, all the amazing songs, witty humor, MUSHU, and even the plot and storyline. I'm fine with remakes not following the exact path of its predecessor, especially if they improve it, but this was a pretty much completely different story that is loosely based on the original. They breeze through parts that, in the original film, were main points for character development and building up momentum. Plus they introduce so much magic that it makes everything logical in the movie so useless.Is weird to say that the cartoon had better cinematography than the live action version? Not to mention better acting. That chilling part when the Huns charge and the soldiers come down the mountain by the thousands used to make my heart skip a beat. The war scenes in this film are just boring and overly choreographed. Mulan's flips and magical moves are really too much and it makes the war scenes kind of pointless. She was much more believable in the cartoon for the fact that, yes while she was a skilled fighter, she also used her brain and devised clever plans and tricks many times to overtake the enemy. She didn't just magically do flips and kick an arrow into the enemy's heart.With all that said - this movie is TERRIBLE and I do not recommend if you don't want to ruin your image of one of the best Disney movies",NEGATIVE,0.9986863732337952

If anyone else made this movie it could be considered pretty decent but it was very boring as a Disney movie where you expect a level of whimsy and emotion. They basically spent all that money to make a typical Chinese martial arts war movie. For that you can pic any authentic Chinese movie off of Netflix for free and be equally entertained as their costumes, sets and action are just as good.They removed the songs ostensibly to make it more realistic but I think they did it because they're now considered non-politically correct. Even the gender reveal was politically corrected to give Mulan agency or something. I guess that's not bad in and of itself but it made the film boring and unsuspenceful.Also Mulan had super powers from the beginning and was guided by a phoenix instead of talking dragon. That direction in and of itself wasn't bad but the way it was implemented was lack luster. Also if you think about it, it gives the idea that women aren't equal fighters unless they have super powers rather than through hard work?The sum of my review though is basically that it's very frustrating because they did a lot in the film but not of lot of the things the audience actually wanted.

The production work feels amazing throughout the movie, the scenery, the midst that revolved constantly around the main character.
The work done around Xian's performance is cinematographicaly great, there's absolutely no lacking there.
This is the type of movie that someone that preys on character development would enjoy to a certain extent, as the drama that revolves around our heroine is noticeable and again, to a certain extent, well played.We follow a girl that had been helding back her true virtues, and to my disapointment, by the end of the movie I couldnt just let go of the thought that we had only seen around 5% of her true potencial.
With every step of her journey, it's possible to feel brief and faint character advancement, but when it truly matters storywise, it just felt too easy.About the fights. I honestly thought they were enjoyable as a whole but as we get little notion of a timeframe, some elements seem to be too scattered and as the movie goes on combat feels weaker and weaker. I couldn't help but to wonder ""Did a small batallion of newbies just hold of a regiment of shadow warriors sent to assassinate the emperor?"", ""How much time did they really spent training? Weeks? Months?"".And I truly hope, with all my being, that there's a version of this movie in native tongue. English in this setting felt a bit awkward and forced in some lines.In conclusion, as entertainment this movie as a whole felt good, the plotline and scenery is light and pleasing to the eye, I can say I enjoyed this 2 hours.
Objectively, I'd have enjoyed it more if the last quarter of the movie wasn't so rushed, the fights could've been more epic and other characters could've had more light shine on to them so the plot could feel more natural.",POSITIVE,0.9967761635780334

Yes, it lacks the humor of the original, but you truly see how strong Mulan is. The acting was fine. It had a few throw back moments, that offered some insight into where you were plot wise. It is a more mature version of the story! The reason I didn't give it 10 stars is because I would've loved to see more of Xianniang.

2020-09-06 00:00:00,"I watch the original Mulan animated movie years ago, knowing they made huge changes beforehand, I dive into this movie with a mindset that this is nothing like the original, that I should enjoy it like a standalone Mulan movie. Still, it was bad to meh. I will avoid spoilers so many of my points will be vague.A movie empowering women and telling them to let go of the ""shackle"" that holds them back, to be themselves and they will discover the power that lies within, but they execute this concept horribly.
The huge issue is they build her up at a Mary Sue character, not her characteristic that made her a Mary Sue, it how she achieves everything, even with the settings of the story, you can still feel that she achieve everything so easily, and it not because she try, that have to throw in some ""special element"" that makes her unique. Talk about taking ""the power that lies within"" literally. Even then, they seem to forget about that special mojo after 1/3 of the plot.The pacing is also the issue, almost 2 hours long, but it feels rush, especially some scenes that can be used to flesh out the character and added more depth to her, but it feels rushed somehow. Even though I try to not compare this version with the animated one, the fact that a lot of scenes are the same, I have to say that the animated was better at establishing Mulan as Mulan, not just some generic she a special main woman character with no depth to her personality. They also try to cram in more original character, but what the points when you can't even have enough screen time for your mains.The characters/ actors were also an issue for me. First is Liu Yifei, I liked her and has high hope for the actor, well, for the first 2/3 of the movie, she was okay, but in the last portion, she expresses little to no emotions, and the last portions are the most dramatic ones, too, such a shame. Li Gong as Xianniang, an original antagonist that serves as a mirror to the character of Mulan, also did not leave any impression either, not only the character doesn't express many emotions, the way they write and cram her character arc was just... sad, very bad writing. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined, that all I can say. Other supporting characters were meh AT MOST.The special effects, musics, actions were average. For Disney, this saying something. It feels expensive, and cheap, at the same time. There was no memorable scene. The whole film was not even a visual feast in my opinion.One dimensional character, mediocre, if not, bad acting, average special effects, scores,... has made the 2020 Mulan a huge disappointment for me, if the audience is kids, I think they will wholely like it, but for adults, especially people that grow up watching the original Mulan, prepare to be disappointed, one way or another.
Rant: Yeah, this is a small segment for me, cause I really, really want to rant about one ""special"" character in the movie, and personally, that character killed the whole experience for me. It Cricket, I seriously hate how he is written, how an insignificant character that can agitated me so, so much. What is the purpose of this character, a comic relief, you every weak, cowardly guys but in the end learn to be strong types?? Poorly written, serve no purpose to the plot.

2020-09-06 00:00:00,"The live-action remake of ""Mulan"" is as two-dimensional as a cartoon.The flesh-and-blood version of the 1998 animated film is a paint-by-numbers tale of adversity, identity, honor and family. It's acceptable but hardly inspiring, classy but stiff, as the hollow-at-its-center tale lacks the soul needed to truly bring it to life.Yifei Liu is the title character, who in order to save her ailing father Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma) disguises herself as a man and joins China's Imperial Army. There, she proves herself to be a true warrior, but is forced to keep her true self a secret because of tradition and prevailing gender politics.Stories of women disguising themselves as men date back centuries, from Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" to the '80s comedy ""Just One of the Guys"" and beyond. The formula tends to be similar across stories - there's usually a bathing scene centered around the threat of a reveal, and there is indeed one here - and the final unveiling causes an initial shock that forces the naysayers to look inside themselves and examine their own beliefs. It's a time-honored storytelling device.""Mulan"" has a chance to set itself apart by steeping itself in Chinese lore, but the film's version of China doesn't dig any deeper than Epcot Center's. The costumes and the settings are on par for a big budget Disney production, but don't transport viewers to another world. It all renders a little flat.Director Niki Caro (""Whale Rider"" and the fantastic ""McFarland, USA"") relies heavily on CGI and wire effects that come across choppy rather than natural. When the characters in films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""Hero"" fly through the air, there's a visual poetry to the fluidity of their movements, and their soaring feels like a majestic reflection of the human spirit. That magic isn't present here, and the action scenes don't achieve lift-off.As Xian Lang, a shape-shifting witch with the ability to transform herself into a bird, Gong Li has the film's most interesting role, and the only character with an interesting arc. Her shades of good and evil, and the kinship she feels with Mulan, show a depth that is otherwise missing from the proceedings.""Mulan"" does come with a simple, empowering message for young girls.

The storyline could have been a little longer and it does feel like a little was skipped over (lots of cuts from the film I'm sure to bring its length down) but it still conveys the story in the emotional and passionate manner I've come to expect of some of Disney's greats.
I'd do a more in-depth review but alas I tend to ramble. So...
I'd rather have a different telling in a ""re-make"" than the same telling performed in a different manner or on a different canvas. So like all opinions, mine is biased to my own perspectives.

Perhaps the special effects weren't up to Disney's par, or maybe the dialogue did seem out of place at times, but the story held 'true'. Mulan's strength of character is not what's in-between her legs (as most movies would have you believe) but rather her heart. That's what makes a great hero. Who they are on the inside. With all that said, they did a great job portraying that. Could they done a bit better writing more fluid dialogue? Yes. Was the effects mind blowing, in my opinion no.

In all honesty if it had been done to mirror the animated film the way previous ones have I probably only would've watched it at the request of my children, but instead I was the one making the request to sit with me and enjoy the film.

However, much of this movie could have been figured out by watching this trailer. This movie is missing one of its biggest characters that made the original movie, Mushu!

The fight scenes were remnants of classic Chinese martial art style and the story did take a while to move in parts, but what movie doesn't take that route. Visually stunning.

It made the success of Mulan Due to her super power which changed the whole core of the story.Overall I think this movie will be liked by kids.

She's a bit irate over this new one and is deeply disappointed there's none of the original songs and that they changed most of the story...All I can say is with all the hype for this movie for all of these months, I don't expected it to be better than this. The story didn't move me, it didn't feel powerful, I wasn't left thinking how I can't wait to see it again.

The same thing with the new Lion King.It's a shame because here you have this all Asian cast, which I know how important it is to the Asian community, but then Disney drops the ball. The love story was weak, almost non-existent. The lesson in the story was, well, what is the lesson to the story? I just feel like I didn't really get much out of it. And it does seem weird that they took a Disney movie that had music and then took away all of its music.I thought maybe they were doing that because the story was going to be so epic and they were going to be edgy and that this would sort of make up for it, making the softness from a bunch of Disney songs ruin it but the story wasn't epic, it wasn't edgy. It was weak sauce the whole way through to the ends. I hate to even say it.I think everyone can agree it looks like a big budget movie, it's Disney.

I had mixed feelings before watching this after hearing about the changes between the original Mulan and how it was going to be much more serious and lacked any of the best supporting characters. But I actually was intrigued with Mulan 2020!The cinematography is beautiful and the lighting is immaculate. It's also not strictly serious, this actually witty and goofy at times and structured the same balance between dramatic and comedic moments for an action movie just like the original Mulan. Another thing compared to the original is that both versions had me emotional sometimes as well. They also didn't do a shot-for-shot remake and actually had moments of scenes where they filmed their own scene instead of just copying it from its predecessor.What throws me off about this remake is that it slides off the grid for its maturity and realism because some (not all) of the stunts look comical as if I was watching a Marvel movie's fight scene. And when Disney was trying to be respectful to the Chinese culture I wished that the whole cast spoke Chinese instead of English. Another thing is that the action scenes feel rushed and too fast-paced. Sometimes the acting threw me off because sometimes some of the characters sound like they're just reciting lines instead of acting how their characters need to feel.With that being said, I completely understand how this is divisive but I don't interpret Mulan as a bad remake!

If you're not going to cultivate a new worthwhile narrative than you need to replicate the story or the original, this does neither. It's like they couldn't decide which to do.
The biggest problem with this film though was just that the payoff was so lacklustre. Seemingly small scaled and uneventful, I can't remember watching a 2 hour movie before where every single person in the room was like 'was that it?' when the credits rolled.
Maybe this movie is just meant for kids, maybe my view is irrelevant.

So let's see the film for what it is and not what people wanted it to be.Going through the cast alone, it's obvious that this film gathered a lot of amazing actors. Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Jet Li, Li Gong, Pei-Pei Cheng. These are some really big names in the Chinese cinema. We also have the two writers behind the new Planet of the Apes trilogy that came out during the 2010s, plus two other screenwriters that don't have any known credits before this film. And then there's the director, Niki Caro, known for emotional dramas based on real events. Oh, and all of this is produced by Disney.Disney is such a difficult word, because usually when something gets done by Disney, it's almost certain that it will be a big hit or at least seen by a lot more than if a smaller studio did it. But then again, if you think of any famous director and then put their names together with Disney, it still ends up more like a Disney film than a film by that director alone, it's like their soul is slowly ripped away from the films by Disney and I feel it's the same with Mulan.It made a lot of sense when the news was announced that Niki was hired as an director and that they were going to make the film more realistic, no songs, no magical creatures, closer to reality - that sounds like something that would fit with Niki's other films and it would also be Disney's most mature film about a girl becoming a man, becoming a warrior, becoming a woman. But then something must've happened. There's a witch that can turn into a bird and Mulan got a strong ""chi"" that works like the force. I have a hard time believing that this is what Niki had in mind when she wanted to make this film more realistic, then good for her, but to me it ends up becoming the opposite.Others have already pointed out that there was never any worry that Mulan was in any real danger, because she was so strong to begin with, having strong chi, she started off great and never developed, unless you call that scene where she takes off her armor as development. I have a hard time seeing how young girls (and boys) can see themselves in someone like this Mulan when she's already so strong and special, instead of having her starting off as nobody and becoming that special someone. If anything it only alienates people instead of giving them hope.Sadly this is yet another disappointment among the many other Disney live-action films, with Niki Caro now joining the group of famous directors like Tim Burton, Kenneth Branagh, Jon Favreau, Marc Forster and Guy Ritchie with much better films outside of Disney's claws.And seriously! What is up with Jet Li's voice, why did they have to dub him? At least try to find a voice that's close to what he would sounds like, this was just distracting when he suddenly had such a deep, grumbly voice.",NEGATIVE,0.9790918827056884

2020-09-06 00:00:00,"The costumes, sets, action sequences and special effects in this movie were wonderfully done! Kudos to the people involved with that portion of the movie! But in terms of emotional courage in its message, there were so many missed opportunities in this production that I left feeling... not much.The actors did the best anyone could with the script they had. You can see them giving a solid effort, and they deserve positive recognition for that. But there weren't any brave choices made by the writers, director or producers, and that made the whole film fall flat. In the animated version of Mulan, gender roles and the moral authority of command structures were questioned. They didn't choose to explore that with any emotional depth, this time.The animated characters weren't perfect icons of virtue and infallibility, and that made them believable. It made them seem human. Unfortunately, in the live action version, we received characters with none of that complexity. It felt like a salute to authority figures, where none of the choices of the privileged ruling class were genuinely questioned. ""The Emperor killed my father and stole our land."" Yet, somehow the Emperor was still considered worth protecting. That's a hard sell, especially without any explanation.This version of the story of Mulan apparently operates under the assumption that everyone receives their due so long as they submit to the will of the state. It came off as little more than an overproduced piece of authoritative propaganda.Oh well. Maybe it'll get another reboot, someday. Until then, flawed as it might be, I'll stick with the animated version.",NEGATIVE,0.998557150363922

This is the ultimate female empowerment movie. Normally I don't care about that sort of thing, I'm not a feminist, but I love how Mulan proved herself as more than just a woman, and she showed that even though she may not physically overtake a man, she was smart and used her brain in order to defeat the enemy. That's what I took away from the movie.In this version I would say that the part of Mushu was greatly missed (Eddie Murphys voice really enhanced the animated version and no remake can ever top that).

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"In live action Disney remakes, there is an over-saturated, too colorful to be realistic, quality to everything that makes each scene feel like you're walking into a candy store. I believe this is meant to appeal to children, reflect the colorful nature of the animated films, and provide a sense of happiness. It plays well during scenes of celebration, but if it were up to me I would prefer more natural color schemes rather than pushed saturation for the sake of simply being colorful. It seems to take some of the weight, quality, and sense of realism away from what we're watching. What it does for me is take the sense of danger out of the action sequences. When things aren't grounded enough in reality, the stakes don't feel high enough to make us really feel a sense of danger when we're supposed to. That said, within the confines that were likely provided by Disney in terms of violence, the fight scenes were pretty good, if not a bit too PG for a PG-13 film. Since they already had the PG-13 rating, I do wish they would have pushed the realism in terms of violence a bit more just to make us feel a sense of danger and worry for the characters. The general lack of that was made up for the few times we got to see Mulan do something like kick a spear into a man's chest, which was quite satisfying.Despite some of the dialogue being a bit cheesy and on the nose at times, I think they accomplished exactly what they were intending to, and made a pretty solid movie for their audience.It's not perfect, but it's very good.Was it worth the $30? Absolutely. Im underselling it in this post. A $30 ticket for a production this massive with so many good elements is nothing.What did they do well?
Most things. The sets, the props, the costumes, the scenery, the casting, the effects, the visuals, the music, the nostalgic elements and callbacks to the original film (which are ever present, yet not overdone or unfitting). There are more good things about this film than things worth judging. Niki Cari did a great job.Many people are saying this is the best Disney live-action remake yet, and I might have to agree. It's a toss up between Mulan and Cinderella.If you're a big Disney fan and you want something dazzling and adventurous to enjoy, or if you're just looking to kick back and watch something great for the whole family, this is it.EDIT: There is one outstanding weakness about Mulan (2020) that I didn't address yesterday when I wrote this review, and the more I think about it, the more I see it as problematic.
They took the concept of ""chi"" and used it as a force-like superpower in a way that I think hindered the film and story more than helped communicate the overall message.
Mulan is not an ordinary girl. In this story, she is much like a Luke Skywalker or Rey type character who is born with this special ability and power within her that she learns to harness throughout time. The story makes it clear that Mulan is not like everyone else. She is special. She personifies the ""chosen one"" storytelling trope (something that wasn't done in the original in which she was seen as a common, clumsy girl who simply stood for the right things and used her intellect, along with a bit of rebellion, to save China).
Giving Mulan these special powers and abilities took the message the movie should have told and turned it into something quite different, effectively saying that normal women can't do what men do. They have to be special.
Why can't we have more films of this caliber and budget simply feature strong female characters without having to give them superpowers in order to make them equal to the average man?
Overall, having given it more thought, I am changing my rating to a 6/10.",POSITIVE,0.9882803559303284

The action scenes were all people running up walls, defying the rules of gravity, which meant there was no sense of danger really. And every archer shoots a bow like a laser blaster...

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"SYNOPSIS:
Mulan (Yifei Liu) disguises herself as a man so she can fight in a war that her father is too old to.REVIEW:
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MULAN WHYYYYYYYYYYYY????*clears throat*Okay. Let me explain. I absolutely love the Mulan animated film. One of my all time favorites. I knew going into this film that they were making some ridiculous changes like taking out the songs and taking out Mushu and adding a new villain in the shape-shifting Xianniang (Li Gong) and I was still completely on board when I saw the trailer. This was my most anticipated film of the year so let me now go ahead and explain why this film left such an incredibly bad taste in my mouth. I'll break this one down into sections.DIRECTING/EDITING/SPECIAL FX:
First of all, the directing and editing/special effects were all so poorly done. For example, there's a scene near the beginning of the film when the invaders (this films version of the Huns and can't remember their name even. Something with an ""R"") are attacking one of the battalions and Xianniang uses a rug to reel this one guard in and there's about 7-8 jump cuts of her just reeling him in. I almost got nauseous from all of the unnecessary cuts just to make a shot look quicker when I'm reality one or two cuts at most would've served that shot much better. Then we had some shots where the camera turned sideways and then back upright and although I think a shot like that could've been amazing, the way it was used was almost just like an experiment. It could've been used far more efficiently. In any of the moments where the characters were going airborne, it felt very messy. I could notice imbalance as if they were stuck to rope, which they are, but is something that shouldn't be noticeable. Not giving any spoilers, but there's literally a scene where a large group of the invaders are on a hill catapulting fireballs at the imperial army and Mulan looks at them from below and in the very next scene is all of a sudden behind them... the only way she could logically done that without being scene is taking a week long trip around this giant hill which by that time would be too late for the other soldiers. Mind-boggling. I can then go on with how ridiculous some of the moves looked to a point where I held in laughter for the sake of the others watching the film with me and didn't want to be rude, but I'd be spoiling the film. Oh and the slow motion shots. My dear lord and savior the amount of slow motion shots in this film. It's truly something to see.STORY:
This part isn't something that I think people would necessarily agree or disagree with me on, but it's just my own opinion. I'm not a fan of how Mulan was already an established warrior. I understand that what they were going for is saying that this ""Chi"" that's within Mulan, is within every woman and it's up to them to know it's okay to bring it out regardless of how anyone else feels about it. I agree with that sentiment, however, the original film shows that even though you may not know it, as a woman, there is a warrior within and that you should do everything in your power to bring it out and to show others that you are just as capable as any man to be the fiercest warrior. Both sentiments are good, but there's something about someone who has barriers in front of them and us as viewers watching them break through the barriers to triumph. When Mulan already has this powerful ""Chi"" it by default makes her have an edge on other soldiers and doesn't create much of a challenge. Yea Xianniang is her opposite, but that storyline was so obvious to predict and there were almost no fighting scenes between the two. And the one or two that were in the film didn't feel intense. Didn't feel like Milan's life was in danger at any point. We had multiple scenes that felt so rushed. Not a moment that I felt any emotion whatsoever. Like the scene where Mulan I think is sneaking up on her dad to see him attempt to hold a straight sword and seeing in his eyes the fear, but the honor he must uphold. It's very emotional in the animation and in this it's completely butchered and void of any emotion. Scenes like the matchmaker that are actually trying to taking something from the original are so disappointing to watch and to know this will be the Mulan for most new generation kids. Then I would love to go on a rant on how taking out the commander love interest isn't necessary (cause you could form feelings for a higher up who's actually a genuinely good person) and how taking out the songs is preposterous, because obviously the original film wasn't sexist at all, in fact it was showing that you don't have to be a man to be a warrior, but that's for a different day.ACTING:
The only performance I felt was slightly above average was Yoson An as Honghui. The only thing is he played a character that almost any person can play. Just be charming on screen. BOOM! Love interest... check. Everyone else, including Yifei Liu, were somewhere between average and just bad. Some was due to writing and a lot was due to just bad acting. I'm pretty sure no one there was comic relief. A couple moments were supposed to be comical and missed. I don't understand why they couldn't have actors to represent those 3 goofball soldiers from the original. I know they have Yao (Chen Tang), but none of them at all resemble the original. If there's no Mushu and no soldiers for comical relief do we really have Mulan? Could we have made a film outside of the Mulan property? I still would've seen it, but yes I know millions wouldn't have and that's unfortunate, but it's better than tarnishing a beloved property.This was already so long and I could write a 10-page essay on how disappointing this film was for me, between the poor directing, bad acting, corny SFX and so much more it's hard for me to even give it as high of a score I'm giving it. The only reason I'm giving it this score is due to the sole fact that I feel part of me is slightly comparing it to the original which I think is fair in ways like when they're literally taking specific scenes from the animation, but the other part of me knows it wasn't meant to be a shot for shot live-action remake. The only redeeming factors was the scenery, the horses and the score that was played at poor moments and was too soft to really feel much from. 2.0/10.",NEGATIVE,0.9993082284927368

The cast and acting was superb. The theme of bringing ""HONOR"" is very important to asian culture so it's refreshing to feel understood thus the constant reminder throughout the film was important.

These are the type of skills the casting director were looking for specifically when they interviewed over a thousand candidates for the role of Mulan. Yifei Liu is perfection in her role. Her acting is some what ""stoic"" which in my opinion represent the Chinese culture perfectly. Yifei Liu was tremendous bringing the legend of Mulan to life .Disney's live-action adaptation of Mulan has earned a PG-13 rating. This would make Mulan the first of Disney's live-action films - based off of animated classics - to earn above a PG rating. This brings in the needed drama and action ramping up the intensity and grit to really make this film shine. I thoroughly enjoyed this epic-scale story about the power of being yourself in a world not ready to accept that, a tale that will likely always have resonance. 8/10",POSITIVE,0.9997157454490662

By setting ridiculous prices for a variety of luxury products the sellers seek to establish a high value for an item with no basis in fact. The outrageousness of the price to view Mulan becomes the story, overshadowing any of the movie's actual merits. Don't misunderstand, Mulan is worth a look. Will you come away thinking, ""Oscar contender"", or ""Movie of the Year""? Doubtful. But while it does have its charms, it is mired in mediocrity with a predictable storyline, stereotypical characters, and borrowed martial arts and swordfight choreography from the likes of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" who did it first and did it better. Under the period costumes and lavish sets, it is your typical ""underdog beats impossible odds"" movie. But credit where credit is due. No where did I see a caucasian, or non-Asian casting, so we have at least progressed from the days of Charlie Chan movies? I do tire of the commonality of the recent spate of movies with women characters tieing down their bosoms to pose as men.

To give it credit, the scenario was really beatiful, the colors were stunning, really something nice for the eye, but that's it.
The acting was bland in every character, there was no emotion transmited (not even in their voices), and even withouth songs they tried hard to get the feeling we were watching them doing the same things, in a cold way.
I really missed Mulán grandmother, it was a nice character, instead we get Mulán's sister, who doesn't stand out.
I really really wanted to enjoy this film, but was too hard to watch, the fact we don't get the ancester spirits watching over her, but we can get some weird flying witch and people who walks in walls it's nonsense. And to top it is the ""chi"" thing.
I really don't understand what were they trying to do, other Disney live action are entertaining, have songs, love, characters with development, even fight scenes that give you a little emotion, but this was the opposite. Why was this not a musical? I still wonder that.
The worst though, was the fact that our heroine didn't even had to make any effort, she just ran away and show the world her real power. It's absurd, she was the best ever just because, and doesn't make you sympathise with her because she doesn't make any effort.

But if I wanted to watch Mulan (1998), I would just watch the original.This movie is not meant to be a re-make, it is meant to be a re-imagining of a deeper story. A legend. A story about a woman who wants to be TRUE to herself but still respectful of her family, her culture, and her country. I think that the comedic relief of the Mushu character would have taken away from the important message that we can all stand to learn from this legend. Mulan learns that what she has within her is NOT something to be hidden away, but a gift that she can share with the world. I also thought the score of this movie was beautiful and the subtle references to the original brought tears to my eyes.If you want to watch Mulan (1998), then watch that movie and don't pay the $29.99 to watch this movie.

In other words, one of the clearest pillars of what makes Disney movies great was removed. This is especially egregious when considering the amazing song options in ""Reflection"" and ""I'll Make A Man Out of You"" that was available and defined the previous 98' movie.3) Instead of replacing the void of Mushu or Li Shang, they introduced new characters in the form of a witch, Xian Lang, that is a confused mix of an antagonist and a savior meant to help Mulan develop her ""abilities"". When push comes to shove, she ends up being absolutely redundant and an unnecessary addition that could have done much better by merely adapting the original characters.In sum, this is most likely the worst attempt ever of producing a good remake, or even just a movie, from the Disney studios and I hope they will be both greatly disappointed and change their approach for future.

The problem I have with the movie are the scenes that didn't add up, some scene were too fast and we weren't given any explanation especially the fight scene with the Emperor. If you take away these unexplained scenes and some exaggerated special effects, the movie is actually okay.",POSITIVE,0.9940869212150574
2020-09-05 00:00:00,"I enjoyed the movie a lot and watched it twice in one night. There are a few reasons why I love it so much1. First, it was well directed to show the struggles of being a woman during that period. For example, Mulan was told to hide her ""chi"", which simply meant her potential to be a good warrior since she was little. However, when she changed her identity to that of a man, her strong ""chi"" suddenly brought her a lot of recognition and compliments. The movie was directed well to show this contrast.2. Second, the movie brought attention to the value of love of your family, being true to yourself and your friends, and loyal to your your country. They are all very important values for life and you hardly see any movies that talk about all of them well. It's a good movie to watch with your kids.3. Third, I think Disney did a great job casting each role. The actress selected to play Mulan has the type of beauty which appeals to both the east and the west. And she has a martial arts background. She did well in all the fight scenes. All the other characters they selected also fit well and were made vivid. I adored Mulan's father. He played the mix feelings of being happy for her daughter's talent but also worried about her not being accepted by society. I am also very impressed by Bori Khan. He looks exactly like the Bori Khan, I imagined.My suggestion is to watch this movie without comparing it to the animated version. Luckily I already forgot that version since it was a long time ago. Mulan has been a famous story for centuries in Chinese history. The actual recorded story is very short. Basically, it only mentioned a woman named Mulan who replaced her father to fight a war since she had no brothers and her father was aging. Due to how short the story is, a lot is left to the imagination for whoever wants to tell the story. I personally think it's great that Disney made the second movie different from the first one. If they made it exactly the same, i'm not sure i would want to pay to watch just a live action version.Overall, I enjoyed the movie a lot. If you have two people watch movie together, $29.99 is a reasonable price.

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"Hua Mulan is a girl blessed with the gift of the Chi which offers her amazing powers. Unfortunately, she must bury her gifts and marry a suitable match in order to bring honour to her family. Northern invaders, called Rourans, march towards the Imperial City, led by Bori Kahn and a powerful witch alongside him. The emperor orders that each family provides a male warrior to fight for the kingdom. Mulan is forced to take the place of her frail father who is the only male in her family.As I do for all adapted films, I will not compare Mulan (2020) with the original animation and I will judge the film on its own right.The first act of the film was an eye-friendly watch that showed us the journey of Mulan from a child discovering her abilities to a teenager struggling with her identity and her place in society. Training in a camp of males, she must do all it takes to hide her true identity as a female and abide by the three virtues of a warrior (loyalty, bravery, and honesty). While all of these sound like solid points, the movie invested an unnecessary amount of time in achieving these, while occasionally being repetitive with its messages.Things quickly turn sour in the second act as the battle emerges. In a weird instance of solely chasing a small army of Northern Invaders, Mulan is lured into isolation with Bori Kahn's witch. Mulan establishes a connection with the witch who encourages her to come to terms with her true identity and abilities. As Mulan embraces her true self, the movie suddenly seems to run out of time as she is shown, in fast pace, to save the Imperial army and eventually the emperor in an extraordinary but cheesy fashion.Mulan (2020) is a visually stunning film for the most part, but it struggles to be anything more than ordinary as it fails to invest in providing compelling action sequences to cement its over-established plot points.5/10.",NEGATIVE,0.8469874262809753

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"At first I didn't knew why the viewer ratings were so low, so I was curious to see this movie for myself. Then I discovered that most user ratings were politically motivated, and nothing but anti-china bots, with nonsensical reasons to make this movie look bad. In that regard they failed their purpose, because its free publicity and it made me actually wanting to see the movie even more.After watching the movie myself, I can truly say it was beautifully made!The movie had good build up, majestically filmed. Yifei as Mulan was charistmatic and her charms added depth to the character Mulan. She sometimes speaks volumes without saying anything, and when she does say something its meaningful, those are rare qualities of an actor.At times it gave me goosebumps to finally see a live action version of Mulan, I have to admit I had to wipe some occasional tears away throughout the movie.Yifei companions were funny and their commaderie was heartfelt.Fun fact: Honghui was historically the love interest of Mulan, not Shang Li from the animated movie ;-)Eventhough without the musical songs that made the animated version popular, but there were enough references to the animation throughout the movie that did honor to the animated version.
All the actors were great and solid, especially the father played by Tzi Ma was convincing as a caring and inspirational father to Mulan in such a short timespan of character development.Sad fact: Historically Mulan fought a war campaign of 12 years. She never did get to see her father again, because when she got home her father already died of old age. Traumatized by warefare, Mulan never became her old self, and she committed suicide, hoping she could reunite with her father in the afterlife being that carefree loving daughter again....The encounter with the Witch (Xinniang) played by Gong Li was superbly done. I think the witch might even have been a metaphor for Mulans inner fears. It was so poetically well executed.I am glad Jetli got to do some of his last few action sequences, as Jetli is suffering from returning illnesses, the reason why he doesn't do much action nowadays.Bori Khans character is the equivalent of Shan Yu in the animated version, and is in the live action more fleshed out as to what his motivations were for attacking the kingdom, that was a nice touch.I recommend this movie highly for the fans of the original anime and for people who are new to the story of Mulan.For me it was A well worthy tribute to both the legendary chinese folklore story Mulan aswell as the orginal disney animated version!",POSITIVE,0.9725936651229858

I actually really liked the live action Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast as well and appreciate their differences from their animated counterparts.-Storyline wasn't well thought out. Started well. But their desire to have over powered women characters really dampened the story in my opinion. To me it would have been a more powerful message if Mulan overcame her obstacles because of hard work, intelligence and grit, not because she was born with chi powers. The witch just was out of place for me. She was pointless.
-But if you're going to have powers, fight scene could have been MUCH BETTER. Battle sequences were ok at best. With some having no wow factor or we're just dumb. At one point I said, ""Ok Mulan has Ultra Instinct...smh""

The movie didn't really explore the feminist theme as well as the anime did, choosing rather to spend more time in the training camp (yet they totally left out any growth about her powers). Its sad that we didn't get to see anything about Mulan's chi. There is alot to be disappointed about in the movie, but i still didn't feel bored as the visuals were done so beautifully, it can actually keep you engaged till the end. Sad as it could have been better though. I would have given it 6 stars, but subtracting 1 in solidarity with Hong Kong. The whole world is with you in your fight to defend your freedom!!

It has beautiful landscapes, a great soundtrack and introduced new, original ideas that sadly weren't executed in the best way. The movie has pacing problems, and a lot of scene supposed to be climactic came up as dull. The biggest fail of this movie, however, is the complete lack of characterization of its protagonists and the messy dialogue, with a lot of grandiloquent sentences but very little substance. There's almost no chemistry between characters, little character growth and the emotions are almost non existent.As a remake, however, Mulan isn't a good one. While it does follow the events of the animated movie in a close way, the movie failed to capture its spirit and complexity, especially when it comes to Mulan, which feels like a watered-down, Mary Sueish version of the animated character. I just wish directors and screenwriters realized that a strong female character is far more than ""a badass woman with no flaws that can fight"".It still remains an entertaining movie, hence the 5.

People who reviewed it that were disappointed and calling it a bad movie don't know what the hell they're talking about. This movie was better without the songs. It wouldn't have been the same and would not have fit in as just a copy of the animated Mulan. I like the animated film too, but I liked the live action version even more.

Let's take emotional impactful scenes such as the introduction of the Huns, The role-call of the enlistment of the families, Mulan fighting about her place in family and leaving home that give the original movie it's beautiful identity. This movie makes those emotion-filled scenes, and well reduces it monotone, un-dramatic scenes. The dialogue is so bad, oh my God... The threat of the Huns or what ever they're called in this is nothing compared to that of the first one. The lack of showing the Huns in the cartoon and just their destruction made them seem that much more menacing. This movie strips that all away. All of it. Mulan's trials to overcome her constraints as a sheltered woman to become the strongest amongst the troops? None of that. She's OP from the start with her chi. And the whole time the only problem in the movie is not her hiding her disguise but her guilt of hiding it. The whole reason was to save her family and not risk her own family's honor. This time, there's no threat of such, there's no threat at all, and the sequence of events to get to that wasn't compelling, she had a fight, she wasn't as strong since she was 'lying to herself'. Like what? You aren't lying to yourself, you're literally saving your dad, and giving your family honor and keeping it a secret to others, it's not a moral dilemma, BUT I SUPPOSE TO THE CHINESE STATE, DO NOT LIE TO THE STATE NO MATTER WHAT ITS ABOUT I GUESS. That is glossed over and just like, 'oh I want to show how strong Mulan is'. And when you take out Mushu, No Eddie Murphy? No entertaining side character? Wow, it's dull. You may ask while watching this, oh it's bad but not bad enough to walk out of. It is that bad. It literally is so bad, I felt like walking out, but I couldn't cuz someone bought it and I didn't wanna be rude. But it was funny we all wanted to leave but felt it would be rude, even the person that bought it. I could write a book on how this movie sucks. I'm thinking of the meme template of The Godfather saying 'look how they killed my boy'. Look, I hate Disney's live action adaptations, only one I could tolerate was Beauty and the Beast. But when you strip a movie of funny scenes you have to replace it with something right? NOPE! Just make the most monotone, dialogue. OH MULAN JUST LEFT HOME, if we get her the army will kill her, the dialogue was so monotone and it was the writers were a bunch of 3rd graders. I am critical of movies, especially when I hold very special place in my heart for its original. I can say, this is perhaps the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Shame on Disney.

It was to show our heavy family values, some of our customs, etc. I enjoyed this because it was different than the animated film, and different does not mean bad. I will admit this movie was geared more towards more international markets, especially in China and other Asian countries, but the point of this movie was to highlight beauty of Chinese culture and values, which I hope you guys can appreciate.Is this movie perfect? Not at all. But I would say I am proud to have this movie as a representation of Chinese people.

The final battle with the villain (hello Jason Lee from Jungle Book 1994) was something right out of mid-2000s Chinese warrior movie. I enjoyed the additions of magic, chi, and a witch. I enjoyed that Mulan still saved her battalion with an avalanche. I liked the cute barracks scenes where Mulan has to still hide her breasts from all these men.The only thing that urked me, since this is PG-13, was lack of blood. I'm so utterly used to bloody pitched battle scenes, that a lack of blood in battle is noticeable. But this is a Disney movie, so c'est la vie.",POSITIVE,0.998658001422882
2020-09-05 00:00:00,"My MULAN REVIEW (pros & cons)
(Minor spoilers)
Film: 7/10PROS:
1. The cinematography of the film is really beautiful, the scenes and colors are great and really feels true to the beauty of China. For anyone who is familiar with the China pavilion at Epcot in Disneyworld, you definitely get that vibe as well! Lots of reds and yellows in the film, you can tell it was meant to be in theaters.2. The characters are likeable in this film, especially some of the boys who she has to train and live with while she's an undercover soldier. Mulan herself isn't bad although she is on the quiet side, she has a sweet relationship with her father and really values family much like the original. Villains are also interesting and different than the original, but in a good way.3. Different added element in the story about Mulan. In the original, Mulan goes to fight alongside the soldiers and does know much about sword fighting or training whatsoever, which isn't realistic considering how fast she becomes an amazing fighter, in the new Mulan however her upbringing is similar but not really, she isn't quite clueless. She makes different decisions but in a good way. You have to watch it, it's makes more sense for the story.4. Without giving anything away there are also things they obviously added to the story and about Mulan and her family that are really nice, some things that would have been awesome if they were in the original. They pay homepage to the original in cool, creative and great ways too. One point my family all went ""HEY!!"" and pointed at the screen during the film (but I won't give it away).CONS:
1. Yes, it's not a musical and there's no Mushu. Some of the fantastic things you love about the original are not there unfortunately. They tried to fill in those blanks by doing other things but it still would of been much better if they had at least added one of the two.2. Mulan has a different personality. While it may make more sense for the story and culture it felt weird that Mulan was so quiet! In the original she is extroverted, argumentative, and sometimes silly at times, but in this one she's very much of a serious girl who loves her family and loves her culture and her kingdom. While her personality change isn't bad, it felt like the casting may not have been quite on point.3. Not on the same scale as some of the other live action remakes. The new Beauty and the Beast and the new Maleficent were 8/10s for me, but this one wasn't quite there. Close but not quite. The plot of the film was different than the original although they kind of are all getting that way, it didn't feel as strong.4. Things from the original are not there. Without pointing out each thing there are several elements and scenes that the original had that this does not. A big character Shang is not in this one but is replaced with an older (more age realistic) general while a soldier that is Mulan's equal befriends her. Even though the difference in the male character's military title isn't bad, Shang is such a cool character in the film and it's a real shame he wasn't there.It still is a good movie. Could they have done better? Yes but it wasn't a fail. I think the director was trying to make a Wonder Woman type character which I am all for, but because it strayed from the original happier version, it wasn't an 8 or above for me. Mulan is still awesome though, and she is still my favorite Disney princess, or should I say warrior ⛩.",POSITIVE,0.9994477033615112
2020-09-05 00:00:00,"Watched it with no expectations and just allows myself to be taken into this beautiful and immersive movie. I loved that it's different to the animation! Why would we want to watch the exact same thing? So what if it's different and there's no Mushu or Crikee? The production is beautiful, the costumes stunning and such a feast on the eyes. In my opinion, the lead did her role justice and the whole cast was great. Not sure what people are complaining about, honestly. So much hard work and love was poured into it and it shows! I saw a reviewer call the worst movie of 2020? Wow, really? That's very low and uncalled for! I watched it with another group of family, we were all thoroughly entertained for a Saturday night in.

The use of symmetry and stylized, clutter free shot design ads a disciplined framework around the characters who play out a story about heart, courage, and family. The story adaptation should be counted as it's own achievement, not as an insult to the animated release. I personally love the affirmation of a father's love along Mulan's journey from her own father, through the regiment commander, and up to the emperor.
Add all this to the locations, sets, costumes and wicked cool fight choreography, and you've got an entertaining and emotional film. One star knocked off because my sons miss the song and dance routines. :-)",POSITIVE,0.9998502135276794

It's a little corny and overacted in places, but that's Disney. Another slight negative is that the battle scenes seemed somehow small and not grand / epic.Overall though, mostly good acting, great effects, excellent music and engaging story.

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"Whether you're talking about the amazing job that Disney did in remaking The Jungle Book in live-action or how they made a very disappointing attempt at bringing Dumbo back to life, there's no denying that they aren't slowing down anytime soon. Mulan was their latest to be released earlier this year, but due to many complications, it has now premiered on Disney+. While I can't say it surpasses the animated original in any way, it's absolutely one of the better remakes they've done. I could see this reaching a wide audience over time, but with this particular release strategy, I can't see 2020s Mulan making a big enough splash. Here are my thoughts on Mulan as a whole.Much like the original film, this rendition of Mulan follows the titular hero as she disguises herself as a man in order to join the war in place of her father. Going against traditional family and gender beliefs, she rises to the occasion and bests everyone around her. She's had training her whole life, so it comes as no surprise at all when she's able to pull off incredible feats, which I feel is the film's greatest downfall, even though it's entertaining. The emotional core is very much present, but things do feel like they're glossed over at times. With that said though, for every minor issue, there was always a positive to balance it all out.As I said, the greatest downfall is that there's not a single surprising thing to the character of Mulan this time around. On top of that, the absence of music is very much felt here, because they chose to include narration, explaining certain character's choices instead. This felt very pointless to me as it felt like it was dumbing everything down for the audience. I truly feel that these choices did hurt the film as a whole. Still, this is a very well-made movie all around.From the score to the cinematography, this film feels epic in every sense of the word. Sadly, with it being sent to streaming, the big screen experience just won't be possible for this movie anymore. There are some massive sweeping shots that would've benefited from a giant screen, but it is what it is. For this reason, I found myself attached to the more subtle character moments, which ended up giving the movie a layer I may not have latched onto on the big screen. Maybe that's just me, but I felt the movie's weaknesses were given an accent with this watch-at-home tactic.In the end, the 2020 live-action remake of Mulan probably isn't going to have die-hard fans preferring it over the one the loved in the past, but newcomers may get a nice story to follow along with. Yifei Liu does a great job in the title role and felt like she was paying homage to the animated film while also making it her own. The original story is still present, but different, which was nice, and the epic scope is absolutely felt, making this a great movie to look at. I will say some of the creative choices/changes didn't quite work for me, but it's still a very enjoyable movie overall. I'd say give it a watch, especially for families.",NEGATIVE,0.5121644139289856
2020-09-05 00:00:00,"Niki Caro was not the right director for this film. She's known for dramatic fare but even still, the characters and their relationships were severely underdeveloped. When it came to action, Caro should have been wiser than to try to emulate a master such as Zhang Yimou. The obvious homage of Mulan's fight scenes to the superior Chinese director becomes very unflattering to Caro's take when comparison is made.The leads were mostly solid to serviceable, but Liu Yifei was perfectly cast. She needed to be the heart of this film and she really was. I had hoped she would be given an opportunity to show a little more range though. Jason Scott Lee was given too little to do as well, a sad continuation of a theme throughout his career.Some of the scenery was wonderful but again Caro made odd choices, keeping the final climactic set piece small-scale. The scope of the cinematography in and around what should have been an epic showdown instead felt very stunted, tight, and closed in. The camera work, along with the choreography, left the final climax feeling bereft of power. The sequence also came off as rather hurried, failing to allow sufficient time for the audience to go along for the ride. A lot of films these days don't strongly established geography within a scene and this final showdown scene was no exception.The movie is perfectly watchable but won't leave you wowed like Disney's animated version did.",NEGATIVE,0.9837262630462646

Last but not least, the acting is terrible, especially the female lead, who is wooden, with no emotion and her acting skills are mediocre at best. I wonder were all the budget went ($200 million). The only good thing was the music.I don't have a problem with all these Disney live action remakes, unless they're done with love and caution like The Jungle Book.

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"Mulan 2020 is kinda of a mixed bag. There are some things about the movie that are fantastic while others that fall short. The original movie is a modern masterpiece but I feel this version lacked the heart and soul of the original. That being said, it's not bad at all. The visuals are breathtaking. Everything from the costumes, the colors, the sets, and action are so pretty too look at.The action scenes are unique. To explain, their clearly inspired by classic 60s and 70s Chinese martial arts movies. These films featured almost superhuman like characters just, well, because. As much as I appreciate this homage, I'm not sure it fit with the tone of the movie. That's another thing, the tone. It can't decide if it wants to be a serious war movie or a lighthearted action flick. The originals tone was lighthearted but perfectly balanced the seriousness of war and mortality. I feel that it would have been better if it took its subject matter more seriously.The acting was good as well. Donnie Yen steals the show as he's prone to do. It was great to see Jet Li again as well.the rest of the cast is solid to great. And there's a certain cameo at the end that made me really happy! The characters are fine but don't always have a lot to do or say. It should be noted that it is inspired by a different version of the Mulan legend. So that's why we have such big differences from the first, which in turn was inspired by a mother version.Mulan may be a mixed bag but I mostly enjoyed it. If you've seen and love the first one you're going to be much more critical. But if this is your first introduction then you may like it better.

A random Disney Fan who grew up on the Golden Era of Disney could have put together a more faithful screenplay. The Whale Rider Director is Pretentious in the ""Vision"" they had for this Film in taking away the music and main characters for more ""Realism""
They could have had the best of both just like with what Golden Era Disney did already, and is Unprecedented for. Comedy, Unbelievable Action, Music that means so much to so many. Reflections was so iconic, and for people who didn't feel a connection to the person they see in the mirror is so relevant today. This movie could have been truly Empowering, but instead it's just ""Woke""
This movie decided to take everything away from what made Mulan what it was and didn't build on it at all either. Took away the Heart & Soul of what makes Disney special. Please don't ruin the Hercules remake like this Russo bros! Take note of the reviews. This is not what we want.

What irks me about this remake is just how boring it is. If I was a kid watching this I would've fallen asleep. All the charisma and charm has been stripped and replace with sluggish dialogue and drawn out scenes. The biggest change that is baffling is to me is Mulan having super powers, which only isolates audience members because she is no longer relatable. In the animation she was clumsy but she was smart and determined, and the empowerment came from her transformation as a character from beginning to end.

I loved the first Mulan and this is a slightly different version that is just as great! Yifei Liu is perfect as Mulan, so is the music and the cinematography. The pace of the film keeps you interested and hooked at all times (at least I was). The only things I would change is the somewhat lack of humor and the existence of the witch which I found unnecessary.
Unlike other hero and Disney movies, the story of Mulan is centered 100% around the evolution of one protagonist and less around secondary characters or their dynamics. In this film, the lead actress did such an amazing job portraying Hua Mulan that it made the absence of other supporting characters like Mushu seem irrelative to me (and I love Mushu!).
To conclude, this film is worth 8 stars but I gave it 10 to balance the unfair 1star reviews.

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As you might now, this remake is one of my most anticipated movies of 2020 (list here). I've at least ""liked"" almost every remake Disney has delivered so far, so I was incredibly excited that 1998's Mulan was getting the same treatment. Niki Caro made it clear this would be an entirely different version of the story we all know and love. A more realistic take on the Chinese tale, one that removes all songs and fan-favorite characters like Mushu, which instantly impacted expectations, varying tremendously from person to person. People who would love a remake quite similar to the original will enter the film already slightly discouraged. However, to everyone who complained about Disney copying their original IP, Mulan might be their best chance to like a remake from the studio.In my opinion, a remake should have a bit of both. It must keep the original's essence and message while delivering something that distinguishes it from the former. Any remake must always prove the reasons behind its existence. It must have something that makes the viewers think: ""I like this part that's not in the original"". Aladdin has a new arc given to Jasmine. Beauty and the Beast provides Beast with a better-developed storyline. Even The Lion King, a remake that convinced many people to call it a shot-for-shot (it isn't), presents a groundbreaking visual experience that's incomparable to the original. Therefore, I was genuinely hyped for Mulan and what Niki Caro could bring with her more pragmatic cut...I can't deny it: I feel extremely disappointed. In my review of the original movie, I mention how epic and cinematic it feels. It was one of the aspects I looked forward to the most in this new version. Despite the beautiful set design and some painting-like shots, this is the first time a Disney's live-action remake loses to its original regarding its visuals. The 2D animation from more than twenty years ago feels superior in every single aspect. There's only one shot in the entire remake that I would put in the original, and I bet it would look and feel a lot more emotionally significant. The action sequences are unimaginative and incredibly disjointed. Except for a few great war moments, most action scenes are packed with excessive CGI, a badly employed HFR (high frame rate), and overediting.In fact, the editing (David Coulson) is weirdly overworked throughout the entire runtime, cutting too much and omitting sequences that were supposed to significantly impact the narrative. From character-defining moments to simple connections between scenes, it feels like the film is hiding something. I constantly needed to rely on my knowledge of the original to remember why certain moments are meaningful to a character or to the story itself because this remake straight-up removes these moments without replacing them with something else. Even in chronological terms, it's clumsily put together, jumping from location to location without actually showing the characters moving from one place to another.Finally, as my last remark on the technical aspects, Harry Gregson-Williams' score is partially also a letdown. Like the rest of the movie, there are some nice touches and lovely homages to the songs everyone cherishes, especially Reflection. I had already mentalized myself to ignore the absence of songs because I believed Harry would find a way to replace them with a similarly grand score that I would definitely enjoy. However, Mulan's score fails not only to elevate a single battle sequence but also to deliver that cinematic atmosphere that I was looking forward to so much. I didn't get chills during the entire film. It didn't transform any big character moments. Maybe watching it on IMAX instead of at home might improve my opinion, but I doubt that.Story-wise, it's a mixed bag for me. Niki Caro promised a more realistic take, totally different from the original, and she undoubtedly accomplished that. This is the furthest from the original any Disney remake has been, by far. From the replacement of characters to an overall change to the main narrative, Mulan is more faithful to the original Chinese tale than the 1998's flick, but that doesn't mean it's better, much on the contrary. The essence and message are there but told through a distinct perspective, which some people will find hard to accept, especially hardcore fans of the original movie. However, I do believe that Hua Mulan still carries the characteristics that made me care about her.Her courage and bravery to go to war in order to save her father from certain death. Her love and devotion to her family, who she wants to honor. Hua Mulan doesn't want to just be the wife of some random man nor be imprisoned by dated stereotypes. This is all in the remake but told through the lenses of a protagonist who already has everything she needs to lead a nation. This is the main difference character-wise, but one that doesn't affect the nature of the original. However, it impacts the remake itself. While all of this sounds amazing, Mulan sort of contradicts itself by making her main character feel unique and different from everyone else, distancing her more from people than actually embracing her.Like I already mentioned above, this is an entirely altered version of the story everyone knows. I do welcome every change made, including the removal of Mushu, Cri-Kee, and all of the singing. However, if something's removed, something else has to replace it in some shape or form. Once again, I have mixed feelings. Some additions, like the introduction of Chi and the witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), are refreshing but poorly developed throughout the runtime. The vital energy force is connected to my issue with the ""be yourself"" message, while the character not only follows a predictable arc, but it diminishes Bori Khan's (Jason Scott Lee) menacing presence.The ending feels remarkably underwhelming as well. Not only the climactic fight between Hua Mulan and Bori Khan fails to live up to expectations, but it's executed in a visually disheartening fashion. I expected this remake to feel grand, magnificent, epic, and cinematic, just like its original or even better. It's far from that. The acting could also be better. Liu Yifei is fantastic as Hua Mulan, Yoson An offers a subtle yet efficient interpretation of Chen Honghui, and the actors who portray Yao (Chen Tang), Ling (Jimmy Wong), and Chien-Po (Doua Moua) are also amusing. However, Donnie Yeng as Commander Tung and Jet Li as The Emperor are embarrassingly bland, while Jason Scott Lee is visually perfect casting as the main villain, but he's not able to shine.In the end, Mulan is the most disappointing remake Disney has made so far and by far. Even though Niki Caro delivers the realistic, distinct take that was promised, its execution feels inferior to the original animated film in every single way. Technically and visually, it's the first live-action remake from the respective studio that loses in almost every aspect to the 2D animation from more than twenty years ago. The 1998's movie is far more epic and cinematic than its remake. The disjointed editing is overworked to the point of omitting and skipping through character-defining moments. The action scenes are packed with unnecessary CGI that takes away from the war set pieces, which also look small in scale. The musical score isn't able to replace the songs from the original, overflowing the film with a weirdly empty feeling. Despite Liu Yifei delivering a good performance as the protagonist as well as a few of her colleagues, the acting is pretty mediocre overall. Story-wise, it's a mixed bag. It's an undoubtedly unique version, the furthest that a Disney's remake has ever been from its original, which will instantly upset some and please others. I praise the courage and bravery in producing such a different version. There are dozens of new additions that I sincerely appreciate, but their execution lacks emotional impact, ultimately being decisions inferior to the ones of the original. The message and essence of the original are still present through another perspective, which is the best compliment I can give to an otherwise quite disappointing remake...Rating: C-",POSITIVE,0.9895390868186952

The pacing was fine. The action sequences were neat yet sometimes hard to watch due to the high frame rate. I also like the effort they put to ""try"" and make it look different from the animated version by adding new substances and deleting every comedic aspect of the original.Here's what I didn't like: The characterisation in this movie was terrible. Mulan had little to no character development in the movie and again they didn't give the villains much more personality. The acting was stiff, you couldn't feel any emotions from them sadly and, I actually didn't feel anything while watching it. They tried to make it look serious but, it ended up discarding everything that made the original soo good and replaced it with nothing. The cgi looked messy at places too.In conclusion, Mulan(2020) is a disappointment. It was a colourful and action packed ride with nothing memorable and they tried to show more of the Chinese culture than the other.

Unfortunately but fortunately they kind of tweaked the story line just a tiny bit which I came to appreciate as you do not want to foresee every single detail from the classic animated film. I learned this from watching the remake of Lion King. Overall, the actress did a great job with her action-packed stunt sequence which was the highlight of the movie. The film creator successfully directed more of a significant film leading up to Mulan's journey rather than input the use of comedy as seen in the animated Mulan. It made sense. A must-see.

Throughout its duration, my feelings/ interest on intensity gamut in a scale 1- 10 did not exceed (with the exception of lady hawk's last scene) the 3-4 score. It was totally flat! You feel no depth in the characters, you do not connect to them in any level. The main actress is pretty, but she carries something very American-like in her manner, and gives the impression of being disconnected to the true depth of Chinese culture. The bows, the greetings etc. are far more shallow than they should be. Considering the era and that it's a woman meeting the emperor, she should not even dare to face him, and certainly not speak for so long in the end. People back then had numerous etiquette rules to avoid being disrespectful and to honour the person they interacted with, ESPECIALLY when talking to their superior. Chinese and Japanese cultures have held their values incredibly high throughout the centuries, they are a very crucial part of their culture and personal identity. In the movie I do not see Mulan bow to her father or showing the deep respect he is entitled to. Her sister is way too expressive, considering her screams and enthusiasm. In most Asian cultures, expressing negative emotions was considered very rude and unpolite, and women learned from a young age to act with silence, respect, and humility, moving slowly and gracefully, being seen but not heard. Ok, it's a Disney film, I get that, but it's supposed (according to the directors) to be true to Chinese culture, which it didn't manage to do very well. I liked the costumes and rich colours very much, and the fact that their haircuts resembled a bit the cartoon's. I also appreciated the fact they honoured the subject and hired Chinese actors and not Korean or other. Finally, I must say I would've preferred the directors to have changed the language to Chinese (since they all spoke it) to make it more historically accurate or, if that wasn't possible, to at least have used an older way of speaking in English, (e.g. Thus, thy, and that kind of style) to portray the movie in a past time.

I don't understand all the hate!
The original was my all time favourite disney movie (and still is). As I got older I had long wished there was a less childlike version that could do justice to the epic action-war story. Step away from expecting a human version of the animation and look at the movie itself.
Story: The epic legend of Hua Mulan. While the Chi/Wuxia style isn't my usual preference, it works in with the tale and plays up her power as a stand-out warrior
Visuals: Fantastic! Wish it had been on the big screen, if the scenery/cinematography are this beautiful to watch on a TV I can only imagine the cinema experience.
Acting: Others have said either acting or characters weren't interesting - I don't think so. Sure, supporting characters aren't fleshed out, but they are likeable. I became invested in the main characters, even though their roles require stoicism. Its not everything I'd like, but I don't feel it lets the film down.
Summary: It's not a replica of the original, stop rating it poorly based on that assumption. With a legendary story at it's core and fantastic scenic visuals, this movie is far better than it's rating suggests.",POSITIVE,0.9761946797370912

I liked the idea of having a witch in the movie.the attempt to accurately represent Chinese culture-the cinematographyThis is what I didn't like. The movie felt flat to me. What made the 1998 movie so compelling is the protagonist. In this version, Mulan is already close to perfect and honestly acts too much like a goody goody. This version struggles to make her relatable, which is one of the reasons why people fell in love with the Disney version to begin with. Another major flaw is the lack of character development. The side characters are just boring. Even the villain is boring and unimpressive. Let's get back to the topic of The Witch. The idea was great, but the execution was poor. Again, why do we care about these characters?I believe this film would've been better with a darker tone and some BLOOD. This is a war story for crying out loud.

I thought that this live action interpretation for the original movie is great.
Unlike the other disney live action adaptations this was different and refreshing. I very much liked the adaptations for beauty and the beast and the lion king but they were almost exactly the same and frankly i prefer the originals.

I mean, even the famous song ""Reflection"" wasn't in the movie which btw the highlight of it. And the scene where she had to cut off her hair that has all the meaning of Mulan's character, was still nowhere to be found. Also, why add a witch where in the 1998 movie, only Shan Yu was the enemy there, no magic, no witch, just him and his army.

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"Disney misled the audience with its marketing campaign, therefore all the outrage caused by mismatched expectations is justified. Unlike Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast which indeed were faithful re-creations of the original, Mulan is a failed re-imagining with a different story, different characters, different settings and basically different everything. To add insult to injury, Disney introduced ""super powers,"" like WTF?The biggest problem is perhaps the tone of the movie, what is it supposed to be? A charming mix of comedy, action, drama and musical like the original? Nope, this Mulan is pathetically trying to be a market-tested Marvel superhero blockbuster. It's doomed from the beginning.I think the great cast has been completely wasted, but the portrayal of ancient China is quite interesting, the intriguing but I'm sure not at all historically correct costumes, beautiful architecture and scenery made an otherwise terrible movie visually stunning, but these are about the only nice things I could say about Mulan.All in all, a lot of wasted potential here, this is what always happens when every decision is made corporate executives with MBAs rather than actual filmmakers.",NEGATIVE,0.9963468313217164
2020-09-05 00:00:00,"This is the best of the Disney live action remakes: it honors the beloved nostalgia amd excels at being its own thing, unlike The Lion King (2019) for example.I totally understand that most folks that despise this movie do that either because there's no Mushu, it's not a musical like the previous one, or because of the lead actress' political comment that one time. So while I decided to view this with caution, I tried to be open-minded.
And, boy, did it pay off.
On its own merit, it's got some of the most amazing action sequences and stunning visuals. There was humor in the places I was not expecting. Right from the first scene, I loved Mulan and her family.
It honors its Chinese cultural roots, emphasising her love and respect for her family, despite her defiance because of that love.As this is a spoilery review, I'll delve into the bits that worried people.
NO MUSHU: Mushu wouldn't have fit in this movie, and it really didn't need him. His characterization was, reportedly, unlike the culture would have preferred. Instead we've got the Phoenix who, while not comedic, adds colour.NO SONGS: We don't watch Braveheart or Schindler's List for the songs, do we? Still, songs like ""Make a Man out of You"", ""Reflection"", ""A Girl worth fighting for"" and the matchmaker song are referenced in musical cues and some of the dialogue. The animated and live action media are very different, and they harnessed on its strengths here.-CRICKET: We got Cricket, alright, and his innocence and humor fits into the story quite well. I loved his reinvention as a supposedly 'lucky' recruit who grows in the movie.
It's not the animated movie: Once yoi can get over that part, you'll be glad it's not.To be honest there are SO many moments that were translated into live action here in ways that brought something new, with humor and heart grounded within this movie and not just rooted in the animated version we know (cough, Lion King, cough).Other winning points are the battle scenes, a surprise redemptive arc for a villain, and the elegant older cast, especially that one dignified cameo of Ming Na, our first Mulan, as she presents Liu's Mulan to the Emperor. It said so much about Asian representation and the weight of this movie as a moment for them.Now it would be unfair to not mention my demerits.
First, I felt some emotional beats at the beginning were a bit rushed. But the deeper I got into the movie I got to appreciate the subtly of Liu's emoting and to know the characters better. Once the movie got into its element, it just kept getting better.
Second ... oh wait, I can't think of a second. It was that good!Finally, I love the fact that we have both versions of the story to enjoy. Once you get past the fact that this is not the other version, and that it's made with the Chinese culture and audience in mind, you'll appreciate the movie for what it is: An Excellent tribute to the animated movie and a Soaring live action Chinese movie.
Like we accepted Parasite, perhaps we can also be accepting of other forms of cinema and let them be what they were made to be.",POSITIVE,0.9981088042259216

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"It's a Disney movie. As expected you'll get a family friendly movie, minus the songs. There are no songs in this movie. Story of Mulan is well known. While bringing a live action adaptation of an iconic character, the main focus should've been to stay true to original. Movie is half an hour longer than the original, which made the movie kind of slow and bought nothing new. An important character who made the animated movie fun is missing, instead you can see a phoenix. There are some good moments but most of the movie are forgettable. There are two Antagonist, both lifeless and forgettable. No showdown in the End. What's funny is the person who can shift shape and bring terror to anyone had a change of heart from a 2 min speech. The one who captured all the outposts without much effort fails against a girl, who have not even finished the training!There is very little action. Final showdown I disappointing. May be they did not get enough time to do more set pieces. Directing is average not exceptional. Additional effects made the movie watchable. Lot of wirework which is not integrated properly and sometimes the giant leaps look weird/ funny.Cinematography is amazing at parts. Especially in the beginning. Some of the CGI are amazingly blended and some are clearly noticeable. Still, with weak direction, it's the cinematography that makes this movie watchable. Set design is okay, there are no scenes where set looks dirty or like people have been living there for long. Incredibly clean and looks like a drama set with a lot of clolors. It sure does make the movie look good but there is no originality considering peoples have been living there for generations and the place looks incredibly clean like it was painted yesterday. No cobwebs, no dust, no dirt. In every scene soldier's armor is clean. Even in the training scenes or after a fight, may be they had anti dust coating, I don't know. There are few short action scenes with less blood even after stabbing and getting mutilated. May be they wanted to keep the movie family friendly. The whole movie is filled with clean sets and costumes!!!!!!For me Music is an important factor while watching movies. Compared to other Disney movies, bit underwhelming but manageable. No songs!! Even the End credit song was average.Yifei Liu as Mulan gave an incredible performance. Rest of the supporting cast performed well but none of them are memorable due to weak screenplay. Li Gong and Jason Scott Lee as Antagonists looked menacing in the beginning since they had a strong introduction. But was handled poorly and in the end they were both forgettable. That I'd say is due to script since the whole focus was on Mulan alone. Jet Li as emperor even though for a short period and Cast of Mulan's entire Family was good. In fact they're the only characters that'll stay with you after the movie. Donnie Yen had few good lines and less action scenes.Overall, what I can say is Mulan is very much like the original, but lengthy and dragging without any memorable scenes. Is it worth the 30$? Strong NO. But, filled with beautiful colors and with Yifei's incredible performance as Mulan, worth a watch. With a beautiful and talented actress to play as Mulan, this could've been Disney's Wonder Woman.",NEGATIVE,0.9393823146820068

For a Disney movie there is a lot of action and grand battle with an avalanche but there is a likeable character with a story and a journey. There is a nice message about family first and a current message about gender equality.
The look of the movie is well done. The country scenery from mountains to desert is picturesque and the cities and palaces look right not overdone but tasteful CGI.
Crystal Liu is a convincing lead. She looks tomboyish enough when dressed as a man so that her disguise is believable. But when her hair comes down she is pretty.
The supporting cast is impressive. The villains are good. Gong Li is more animated than usual and an attractive and memorable villainess. Jason Scott Lee has aways been an enthusiastic actor. Anson Yo as the lead romantic interest isn't impressive enough. A bit underwhelming. Too small a cameo from Ming Na Wen.

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"After the horrendous Lion King, I didn't have any expectations for yet another unnecessary Disney adaptation. Luckily, Mulan wasn't one of the Disney animations that I was obsessed with as a kid so i barely remembered the plot and it almost felt like a new film.Imagine a person painting a palace. At first, it looks splendid with a balanced use of colors and beautiful backgrounds. The painter is no Da Vinci but the work is formidable and we can see it coming into shape. Then all of a sudden, the painter feels like she is running out of time so she just dumps the remaining paint onto the canvas. Before handing it in, she desperately adds a few final touches to try and bring out her initial intentions. This is what watching Mulan felt like.Disney took the understandable direction of scrapping the songs and most of the goofy stuff in an attempt to make a Chines-epic instead of a copy paste of the original. Three quarters into it, I flet good about the characters and the atmosphere. Liu Yifei was great in her organic portrayal of a strong heroine without forcing anything whether through action or dialogue. Then everything became a crazy Kung Fu movie as the pace turned up 300% and all the build up and consistency were tossed away in favor of action and forced messaging. They did try to patch it up in the end but the spirit was lost.Mulan is an ok film to watch as it looks good, has pleasant characters, a bit of jokes and good messages. Unfortunately, these Disney adaptations can't decide if they are proper films or animations where things can happen without logic and characters can evolve in a split second for reasons unknown to humankind. Mulan was a perfect opportunity to scrap all magic and crazy acrobatics to just have a wholesome movie that could be enjoyed by all ages. Sadly, we get another kids film but this one has no joyful songs or sweet gimmicks.Movies.shmovies on Instagram",POSITIVE,0.9885313510894777
2020-09-05 00:00:00,"Every character was one dimensional. When there were scenes of tension, trying to manipulate the audience to care about someone or the plot, they fail because we as an audience do not care about the people we're watching.I just didn't care about the characters and there was no tension; no one had a clear motivation or rather, their motivation was bland and uninteresting. Everyone was forgettable instead of Mulan because that's the title of the film. The movie gave little to none scenes in order to flesh out the characters; they tried but failed at giving everyone their unique characteristics and a reason on why they're together as ""friends"". Stated once more, I just didn't care about who I was watching due to said reasoning. On another note, almost everything was poorly executed such as the editing, use of camera movement during action scenes and dialogue scenes, the script, CGI, acting, and the overall plot. Most of the actions scenes were quickly cut. And for a film involving Donnie Yen and Jet Li (although they're fairly old now) they were extremely under utilized for any action scenes. For action of itself, there was no long takes or even 5 second take to give the actions scenes any impact or any importance. Also, the use of slow-motion during the fight scenes were tiresome after the first time in use. Onto another subject, personally, I would've enjoyed if the dialogue were to be presented in Chinese (pardon for my ignorance for not knowing the correct phrasing for the Chinese dialect) in order to give that authenticity due to movie being live action with heavy Eastern-Asia influences. The themes the movie tried to explore were poorly executed and not impactful at all.Something that I can give credit where credit is due is the use of the abundant extras, set designs, clothing, and how the movie wasn't a shot for shot remake similar to the original movie.Overall the movie felt like is was just marking checks into the check box. I felt no passion or care while watching.

As a stand alone movie, it is nothing but serviceable. Before the final comfrontation, it was just fine.. it quickly nose-dived to absurdity and a lack of devotion to movie making. When compared to the original animation, it is clear that this one pales to the amount of detail and love poured on the first iteration.You can't deny the production value, some great scenes (preparation for Matchmaker) and strong visuals.. specially locations.But yet again, like with Aladdin, changes made to this life action adaptation are a detriment to the original story.
Mulan being able to finally climb the mountain doesn't come from effort or talent. She just does. The infamous Mary Sue syndrome. Can't get a female lead right..Chasing after the Khan alone, as an excuse to face the witch alone (in a secluded place), only for a pointless change of character. And the reveal to the troops, followed by her expulsion means a LOT less when her companions don't know the value of her deeds. No one saw her actions to bring down an avalanche, saving all of them (well, physically saving only one). This is a change for the worse in every way.. and only one example of their tampering.Lessened impact to scenes (reaching the horrors of war), lack of depth without musical tone. Switch between playful life and reality is non existant.Unearned character traits and arcs.And worse of all, the whole ""Join me, we will take our place together"" line.. a touch of Start Wars, to top it all off. With Chi being like the force.This version of Mulan simply gains everything by doing nothing.. unlike the original, where she still acts true to her feelings, by keeping the people in mind and putting REAL effort into her actions.. Even if it means a bigger disgrace.
In this one, she isn't just trusted by a small group, she is basically forgiven. She is suddenly the most important piece on the chestboard.
It isn't properly stablished, that she is on par with the witch.. She just IS their best warrior.
Even taking away from the Khan himself.. everything he accomplishes, it's because of Magic, and a tenues position of power over a Witch that is not credible.

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"The fairest thing, when it comes to judging, would be to divide Mulan's review in two: Mulan as a stand-alone movie, and Mulan as a remake.As a stand-alone movie, Mulan was a pretty mixed bag. The landscapes are beautiful, the soundtrack, great, and it provides a lot of interesting, new ideas, which sadly weren't executed in the best way, being the villains a prime example of this.However, emotion-wise, the movie felt very flat. I blame it on the lack of characterization of Mulan and other protagonists, and the poor script, that included very forced dialogues with grandiloquent sentences but very little substance. There is barely any chemistry between characters and most of the pivotal moments in the movie came up as dull. Mulan, both the movie and character, are void of any emotions. That, added to the pacing problems, makes this movie feel rushed.As a remake, it's not really a good one. Mulan is a completely different character here, and a lot of the values she represented in the animated movie are not present here. Far less complex than her animated counterpart, Yifei's Mulan doesn't really ""feel"" like Mulan at all. And I'd say that Caro is guilty of a sin as old as time when it comes to empowered female characters: the concept that a strong woman is a badass woman with no flaws.In short: a mixed stand-alone film with flaws and redeeming points, a bad remake that does not really capture the magic and spirit of the animated one.

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"This is not a scene-by-scene remake, as other Disney live-action are, and that's a good think. I believe that following the original story to the letter will always leave the live action at a disadvantage (among other reasons, due to the nostalgia factor).Another thing that it has going for it is the lack of musicals. Don't get me wrong, I love Disney musicals...on animated films. I think that musicals in live actions are lackluster and sometimes even cringy. Anyway, if you were expecting that you will be disappointed.What didn't worked for me? Some changes to the characters, or the addition of new ones, that don't really add anything to the story; some parts of the new plot that don't make much sense; and the totally unrealistic action that reminded me of the typical unbelievable asian kung-fu movies (it wasn't like that in the original, so why on earth would they do that?). Besides that, the way they portray Mulan it's too cold, it prevents the viewer from caring, and I think that's the whole point of this story.It was interesting, but I don't see any point in recommending this over the original.",NEGATIVE,0.9986671209335328

I am so pleased with the background music and those beautiful scenes.I saw many reviews with one or two points complaining about no dragon and cricket in the movie.

She wasn't suppose to be like a Jedi. What I loved was that originally she was clumsy, a disgrace, screwed things up, and she transforms into a warrior later and we get to witness that triumphant transformation. The Matchmaker scene and her decision to leave should have been more nostalgic, even if they did a couple cash-grab scenes I think people would have preferred a bigger nod to those.

However, many of the creative differences that were written for Mulan were odd and sometimes very unwarranted.Beyond changing a lot of story line- which is fine if you look at it as a different movie than the animated version- the fight sequences were absolutely atrocious and cringe-worthy, and directed terribly.I enjoyed the casting, and small scenes that alluded to the animated version.

Basically saying that only women can be stronger than men, if they have some sort of supernatural gift.

This movie follows the key storyline of the animation, but it is not a carbon copy. So don't expect it to be like the animation or you'll be disappointed. If I based my interest in this movie on the reviews alone, I would not have watched it. But thank goodness I did (watched it, that is).The movie is beautifully shot on location with grandiose panoramic shots, and authentic looking sets. The action can be engaging, and beautifully captured. Some unique action sequences, but for most part nothing you haven't seen from these genre of movies before. Like wire work action sequences but not overly done. Overall, it (the action) adds to the story telling of the movie, and not detracts from it.But for me the biggest plus of this movie is, it's not a musical. Thank goodness, they didn't turn this into a musical, like they did with Aladdin. This is an action based movie, where the animation's original musical score is played in the background at appropriate moments, instead of being front and centre.If looking for an action based movie with a feel good story, give this a go.

I'm always impressed with the vivid coloration and picturesque scenery of most big production Chinese movies and ""Mulan"" followed that same mold. ""Mulan"" does fall victim to a persistent theme in modern Chinese movies, and that's the theme of old tradition versus modernity. That theme has played out in many Chinese movies to varying degrees of success.""Mulan"" is about old versus new and also about bravery, sacrifice, honor, and all other traits you'd expect to see in a battle movie. In that respect, ""Mulan"" is a solid movie. For the most part it was by the numbers with the addition of a Disney budget to give us some extra cool visual effects.

The messaging is fairly simple. While this film isn't bad by any means, it doesn't excel at anything. It's a very average film that you will watch once and never really feel the need to revisit. The animated version is far superior. My only real complaint with this film is the way they handled Mulan. Bringing in the magical ""chi"" element made her a sort of ""chosen one""; as a result, she doesn't face much conflict throughout the film and doesn't really grow as a character. It would have been better to not include this chi and, rather, have Mulan achieve her caliber of strength and power through hard work as opposed to some magical element.

With a production budget of $200 million, it is the most expensive film ever made by a female director.Director: Niki Caro
Writers: Rick Jaffa (screenplay by), Amanda Silver
Stars: Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Li Gong, Jet LiAmazing set pieces. Every frame is like a work of art , stunning to look at . The film score is top notch . This film is not a musical and that decision to remake Mulan (2020) as a historical action drama really pays off in the end .Bringing the audience a fresh and new cinematic experience differentiating this fresh story from the charming Mulan (1998) American animated musical original.The action and martial arts fight sequences are very well done.
Yifei Liu as the live action Mulan I read did 90% of her own stunt work . She rides horseback , wields a sword (Single-handed jian and scabbard of the 18th-19th century.) very convincingly. These are the type of skills the casting director were looking for specifically when they interviewed over a thousand candidates for the role of Mulan. Yifei Liu is perfection in her role. Her acting is some what ""stoic"" which in my opinion represent the Chinese culture perfectly. Yifei Liu was tremendous bringing the legend of Mulan to life .Disney's live-action adaptation of Mulan has earned a PG-13 rating. This would make Mulan the first of Disney's live-action films - based off of animated classics - to earn above a PG rating.

They get away with it by cutting the camera to another camera just as blade is less than an inch from being thrusted into an enemy solder. So we get implied kills without the carnage.The only shed of blood comes from the witch that nicks her finger on Mulan's sword and a few small droplets fall on the ground.

But I did not watch the original animated film so I had nothing to compare it too.I honestly think this film will have many friends and enemies in the the industry. Not because of the content of the movie, but buy the business experiment Disney is doing by providing a $30-PPV option that are scare people who work for the entertainment theaters. If Disney succeeds and makes a large amount of profit, other companies might be tempted to jump in and bypass the theater openings all together. Those industry insiders can see their theater chains under threat.Today the best image quality for films is arguably at home with newer OLED technology TVs that really make these film pop in a way theater projection cannot. Yes, the $30 price is higher, but I can see friends chipping in to watch this on a really high end television and HT system and make better food at home. In that case, the $30 price pails in comparison to taking a family 4 and concession goodies can easily go three times over that initial price of $30. Disney promotes itself as a family movie company so....hmm the writing is on the wall. Theaters are dying. OLED gives better image quality *Today*, QD-OLED, even better tomorrow, and MicroLED display technology in the distant future will just pat the dirty down over the grave of the movie theater houses. The die-hart theater lover will go into the dark kicking and screaming as the home screen becomes the new venue to watch these films.EDIT Sept 16, 2020.
Apparently there is a huge political Brouhaha over this film that I wasn't even aware of when I wrote my original review above which explains the passionate dislike for the film. Non-Asian Americans just don't like how the songs were left out from the original animation. Asians (both in the US and abroad) are angry at the protagonist, actress Yifei Liu, support for the Chinese CCP crackdown on the people of Hong Kong. And in some irony, many mainland Chinese are upset of the portrail of the real life historical Mulan in this film as being pro-emperor (pro establishment) rather than pro-family. So it seems Disney managed to piss off everyone. In any case, I still think its an okay Kung Fu action adventure even if it isn't historically accurate. Perhaps Disney should stick to animation instead of live action. Their record with live action isn't very good lately with fans.",POSITIVE,0.9750176668167114

While Mulan had her secret, the writing seemed stronger. After her secret was out, it seemed that the writing got lazy.

I don't Facepalm at movies often but...They didn't take advantage of combat scenes. They really could've went with some epic battles. There also was never a time where I felt Mulan was in danger.

Unfortunately, the release date has been postponed due to the pandemic, but I got to watch it finally. It is EPIC! All the waiting is worthy now.The cartoon version has been very popular, while in the live version the director did a more mature and realistic retelling based on the historical legend of Mulan, instead of a lazy copy. That's exactly what I expect. As I grow up from a little girl, I look forward to deeper and more inspiring understanding of the character and spirit of Mulan.LoyalBraveTrue is the motto of Mulan and also the theme of the movie. My blood boiled witnessing the transition of Mulan from a little girl to a qualified soldier. It wasn't an easy and smooth one. When Mulan left her family and joined the army, her idea was to take her father's place. After overcoming all the difficulty and self-doubt, she finally followed her heart and found her own place. I really appreciate the meticulous depiction of Mulan's growth, and the actress perfectly embodied the strength and grace of Mulan.I am also deeply touched by the graceful dynamic between Mulan and Father. ""I am blessed with two daughters"" is my favorite line. It is the love, trust and support from Mulan's family that encouraged her to fight.In the end, I will not spend too much time talking about the fantastic cinematography, exhilarating action scenes and stunning visual effects, as I am not an expert.

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"It's another age old question that comes with each year, why are we getting a live action remake of a Disney classic? Well the answer comes in many forms, but I'm more about is this remake worth it/good? Given my experience with home releases... these films have not quite held the same bite that the theater has, so I was a bit worried about this delayed feature. However, my reviewing call has me diving in as I take a look at the latest to hit the small screen from Disney, the live action remake of the film:Mulan (2020)Director:
Niki Caro
Writers:
Rick Jaffa (screenplay by), Amanda Silver (screenplay by)
Stars:
Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Li Gong
LIKES:The Culture And Mythos of China
The Looks
The Fighting at Parts
The Sound Track
The CinematographyDISLIKES:The rushed Story
The Political Prowess Vs. Storytelling
The shoddy Attempts At Making Other Story Components
No Attachment to the Main Characters
Villains are highly downgraded
Comedy Is Forced
Missing the memorable music
The Battles Are short, A bit Cheesy, and Uncoordinated
Battles Lack Suspense
Missing the Spirit Of the OriginalSummary:It is always inspiring to see the surrounding lands of international countries and Mulan gives one the sense of visiting China and it's beautiful world. This film's camera work and design dive heavy into the mythology of the Asian provinces, helping to bend them into the winds of the tale and introduce us to some symbolic values of the culture. This production focused very heavily on the concepts of honor and the discipline the feudal era of this land instilled on men and women who served the dynasty. Maybe a bit stereotypical, but I felt the director was able to integrate the components well and give us the political and story elements that we expected to drive our heroine. The live action Mulan also has a beautiful aesthetic to the characters with the rich patterns, artistic makeup, and props I expected from my limited studies of the ancient lands of China. I loved the build of the world and settings, feeling immersed partly into the field and taking my place next to Mulan and the world that would be her arena.
Speaking of arenas, the fighting of this installment at times steps up its game from the cartoons, breaking out martial arts and weapon styles that I dreamed of doing as a kid. Mulan herself shows off several styles that mirrored the great Kung Fu Works of Lee and Chan (not nearly as fluid, but grandiose) as she fought the army of extras. Other characters managed to pull out some impressive moves, with rapid sword play and archery poses that held that exciting touch I love to see in my fights. While these moments are sparingly, I do give them props for the execution at times and the panning shots of the war as CGI meets real world. And if you're a parent you got to appreciate the censorship so that the little ones won't be corrupted. Amidst all this is a beautiful soundtrack, filled with the symphonic works of regular cinema orchestra and Chinese instruments working in tandem to help bring more emotion to the scene or sequence. And despite not having the most vocal work, Christina Aguilera gets her reprise in this film alongside a few other artists at the end to help further broaden Disney Soundtrack creations, which I think came a little too late, but better late than never right? Yet the best thing for me was the cinematography, and how well it captured the environment, the scale of the fights, and those key moments to help bring this live action more to life. Mulan's visual team deserves a lot of credit for helping add flare to the movie, and give you many references and approaches into one semi-cohesive product.However, there were a lot of shortcomings for me in this film, which could have been due to watching it at home magnifying them or just the movie itself. The story is rushed, with a lot of pieces thrown into the story and then quickly diced out in various sizes. Caro and her staff tried to inject a lot of things that included stories of training, friendship amongst the soldiers, potential romance, the concept of honor, several villain developing, fighting for herself, and trying to hide her identify. Sure the other version did this, but it did it better, as this film lacked the balance it needed and the fluid execution that other films have done. So many of the characters were background, their names barely mentioned and their stories even sadder as they tried to force everything into bite sized pieces. Only Mulan's moments held any backbone as her father and hers's relationship promised a strong beginning, that petered out to Mulan being the only one capable of doing much of anything. I was not attached to most of the other characters, as there was just no focus on them, little personality, and diluted involvement compared to the loveable band of the cartoon. To get the arrows shot at me, I feel this is due to the current method of political agenda over story, this one being the focus of a woman defying all odds to save the war. I have not read the full legend of Mulan, but I expect the writers amplified the woman hear me roar and kind of forgot the other parts of the story. It was that focus that took away from so much of the potential of the movie and all the other characters that could have made Mulan's tale even better and more fulfilling. Even the villains held potential, but sadly the two main villains were reduced to elaborate, overacted one liners, some empty threats, and few ridiculous looking stunts. I know Shan Yu held little backstory, but there was fear, power, and a merciless mindset to him that made him deadly and a true villain. This guy had a slight mention of his back story and goals, but that was about it as so much of his promise was washed away with the scattered displays of the other characters and the focus on Mulan's struggles.
In regards to the other areas of improvement, Disney seems to have a hard time being naturally funny anymore, and instead works to force laughter into a film that doesn't need so much of it. Live action Mulan has little that made me laugh, only the innocence of a youth and few funny tatters getting a chuckle for me. Though the movie had great music to set the stage... it still was not the same magic that Disney laid on my ears years ago. Gone where the whimsical thoughts of the fellow soldiers in song and dance, or the deep ballad Mulan questioning her identity that brought so much life to the cartoon. Those songs obviously would be out of place in a more serious film, but when you don't support those components strongly, I started to really miss the campy numbers. But again this movie was supposed to be more on showing off the warrior side of Mulan and as I said earlier in ways it did. Yet... in many ways it still failed to pull everything together. This film's approach again seemed uncoordinated in how in depth they could go, perhaps due to the political focus, perhaps due to the censorship that Disney seems to force on its groups. Mulan's fights are short with most lasting less than ten minutes, and most of the good fighting scenes lasting less than two. While paying tribute to the classic fights via flying through the air with cables and over the top acrobatics, the movie did a little too much of this and forewent crafting a battle that was coordinated. Scenes jumped around, passing glances of our main cast doing a movie haphazardly interlaid with Mulan doing know wrong, and even the clashing of armies was reduced to overhead shots that were only okay to watch. I felt no suspense for any of these fights, because there was no heat and without caring about the characters I did not really have any ties to the fights at hand. As you can guess, though the cartoon did not have the most action set and worthy fights, it had characters and tense sequences for me because I had grown to care for the small army and that's what made them special. This one though... missing so much of that and thus while visually beautiful, creative and storytelling wise they were arrows that missed it's mark.The VERDICTDisney made a fair shot at the tale of Mulan and succeeded on the fronts I think they were wanting to succeed on. It's a powerful display of culture and opening up the world of Chinese myth, with costumes and cinematography to really wow those who appreciate these effects. Those looking for the girl power tale will also be highly pleased with this, for many highlights of the fighting are indeed Mulan's moves and the training she shows off amidst heavy instrument work and sound editing. Yet, the film fails to grasp the magic of the last movie and the components it wanted to focus on were disjointed, not well fleshed out, and very lacking if it did not center on Mulan herself. I did not grasp onto the other characters much at all, I felt no real development of so many elements, and all the facets of the story failed to reach their full potential that I know Disney can make work. As for the battles, again visually the look beautiful and have nods to classic styles of fighting, but they lack the heart and suspense I think these moments need. As such, this Mulan lacks much of the spirit the original cartoon held in more ways than one. Was it worth the thirty dollar admission for early viewing? The answer is no for me, and I would wait this one out for viewing in December when it opens up. My scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 6.5

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"Mulan in my opinion was a excellent film that strays away from its animated counterpart in great fashion. I love how the film stayed more true to the actual Chinese Legend rather than the G rated animated film.Yes, There are definitely less jokes in this film compared to the animated version. But keep in mind this a PG-13 film that revolves around WAR, honor and truth. This version does a great job of representing the actual fear of being in war unlike the animated film.
It really does convey a different tone when the characters aren't all silly and singing. This leads me to my next point.There are NO singing/songs.
I'll be honest. When i heard that there wouldn't be any songs it was almost a deal breaker. How could we forget the classics like a ""Reflection,"" ""Make a Man out of You"" and ""A Girl Worth Fighting for."" But ohhhhh i would be lying if i said it wasn't enjoyable to hear the instrumental in the background or hear it referenced in the dialogue. Again, i'm happy that the movie strayed away from singing and focused on conveying a vibe more suitable too war.Does it focus too much on Feminism?
Simply put. As a asian male. No, No i don't think the film is shoving a strong female character down our throats. It's simply about a woman who secretly takes her old and weak fathers position in war. The film also doesn't convey the idea that men are bad. The only man that seems even the slightest bit misogynistic is Bori Khan, and he's the bad guy! He's the one who treats the ""Witch,"" as his instrument to get what he wants. Even still, the movie displays strong male characters too! Who appear either equal to or stronger than Hua Mulan at first!The Other Big Changes!
No Mushu - Mushu was used a comic relief. This is no longer the cartoony film that everyone is so use to. Everyone complained about Lion King being the exactly same. I'd say that people should appreciate these changes.
""The Witch"" - I don't think people understand that the Witch is actually a great character. The idea of Mulan and her contrasting yet being so similar is amazing. It pushes development of Mulan as a character more.In conclusion, The Movie is great. I recommend people to stop comparing it to the animated film and expect a cartoony and goofy film.",NEGATIVE,0.9167712926864624

The lead actress was amazing as Mulan, she did a fantastic job along with the rest of the cast.

What original Mulan are we talking about here? The animated movie? I hate to break it to you guys but the original Mulan wasn't a animated movie, it was a story Written in Chinese scripture. This movie is meant to more accurately depict the true story of Mulan without it being westernized. Saying this movie is terrible because there's no music number like the 1998 version is just plain idiotic. The movie is great overall.

How we appreciate the enemy was changed from Hun to Rouran for historical accuracy. I'm glad there were no talking animals.
Though this is quite different from the cartoon, it's a really good different. Personally, I think if they just did a duplicate of the cartoon into live action, it wouldn't be appealing to me.

As someone who has been a long time fan of the original, this in my opinion was a lot better than the original. I say this because I loved the new characters, especially Xianniang the new villian played by the legendary Gong Li. She was a very great villain.
I also really loved Liu Yifei in this movie, a few of her moments especially one of her moments at the end really got my teary eyed. She was amazing as Mulan and Niki Caro was right that she was without a doubt the best Mulan. I give full credit to Caro for choosing her and I don't give a crap on what anyone has to say about her.
While there are a lot of changes, there is also scenes from the original changed up a bit. Like the matchmaker scene instead of it being with a cricket, it was with a spider instead. Some of the fight scenes were similar but most were brand new for this remake.

Beautiful imagery, epic action scenes, and impeccable camera work create a film that is pure ART. Saying this film is empowering would be an understatement. The story of Hua Mulan has been hugely inspiring to many women, but it even brought me (a male) close to tears. Her journey is truly inspiring and shows the beauty, power, and grace of a woman.

It's stunning visually and made me giggle a couple of times and made me feel warm Inside. It reminded me of my young years watching Disney originals. This doesn't claim to be the original. It's been adapted and modernised which is what it's supposed to do like with everything in life moves with the times. I feel it captured the story well and made me reminisce of when I was a young girl watching it. Surely that's a good remake??? For me it's visually so much better then the original and I enjoyed as much as the original in different times. The acting was great. Few things I would of changed but nothing too much.

When it was announced that Disney was trying to make a more ""culturally and historically accurate"" version of the movie, I was excited! But this movie, unfortunately, does not deliver on any of those promises. The inaccuracies may fly over the heads of audiences who are not Chinese, but anyone who is familiar with the culture and history of China will find the errors glaring and unforgivable. I mean did they not hire any experts in Chinese history to advise on anything??? Costumes, architecture, swords, even hair, are ALL inaccurate to the period and just Han Chinese culture in general. I know this is for American audiences, but then why claim to care so much about ""cultural accuracy""???In addition to this, the editing is so incredibly jarring and choppy. Several times in the movie characters seemingly teleport from one area to another. The pacing is very poor as well, with some parts dragging on for too long and some parts glossed over in just a few seconds.Overall, disappointing.",NEGATIVE,0.9996559619903564

The sets and figurines were beautiful. There was really bad cgi and some good. The soundtrack was forgettable although there were references to the songs from the animated classic that I appreciated. I liked the fact that its a different story from the animated, unlike other Disney movies that copied the original and gave it a National Geographic twist(Lion king).But i would like to see a better growth on the main character ... Mulan´s already a incredible ""acrobat"" from the beginning of the movie. I would have like to see her SLOWLY discover how amazing of a fighter she is.
There were some but very few funny jokes and moments. The stunts and fight scenes were good I really did enjoy them...
In conclusion its far from being a great movie but i did enjoy it. Not worth the price that Disney is asking 30 something dollars is too much for the quality of this movie. I wont be watching the movie again.
Maybe if the main actress didn't support the violence that the Hong Kong police provided to its people i would enjoy the movie more ...

2020-09-05 00:00:00,"You can tell if a movie is going to be a well-produced one by its first 10 mins or in some cases, merely 5 mins. This Mulan movie at the beginning shows off the young Mulan jumps effortlessly onto a high roof to chase a rebel chicken. She slips off the loose roof tiles but flips upright with ease as she plunged to the ground. Nothing wrong in setting up the story in this manner but it's the way they made her Kung Fu-ed her fall in an obvious stilted style exactly like a puppet on strings.We know Kung Fu heroes or heroines can't leap effortlessly onto a 20 feet high roof and command impossible gravity defying feats by mere light footholds. While the film makers can remove the strings and harness digitally, but they don't have to have the actors moved like they are on strings. This is the same as with Michelle Yeoh's The Touch (citing one example of similar genre) her stunts there are painfully difficult to watch and appreciate. Yeoh just as Disney's Mulan's YiFei Liu can proved to be A-class actors in the hands of a better director and stunt choreographer.The choice of Mulan's father played by the indefatigable and veteran Chinese actor, Tzi Ma, could be more convincing given another Chinese actor.Also, film makers could have avoided the temptation to employ generous use of CGI just because they could afford it.It's a shame that Disney with all its years of film making experiences and what-money-could-buy resources could have done a better live action film with an inspiring story like Mulan.

At the beginning the movie goes all fine. Your awe and expectations grow and grow and then starting from the middle, it becomes sooo cheesy! Level of cliche reaches the roof! Is Disney underestimating our young generation? Do they not know they are used to exploding buildings and dead hit gun-fires? Oh, yes, sure, the last scene was moving. But that one redeeming quality can only do so much. Who in the right mind can be okay with that horrible time pause they portrayed in the war scene?

The core difference between the film and animation is the psychological change process of the protagonist, from passive to active, from being discovered to being a woman, to honestly facing his identity as a woman.

-Scenes that were meaningful and funny in Mulan are nowhere to be found. I could deal with no Mushu, but replacing it with a phoenix that randomly shows up and float about? Ugh.-They replaced the grandmother with a sister, which adds nothing to the film.-They added a new villain, the witch, which could have been completely omitted. I see that they attempted to do something cool and interesting to make it different from the original. It failed miserably.-Scenes were rushed. We hardly got to see the soldiers really bond. Ling, Yao, and Chien Po have few lines and are forgotten quickly. Their progress doesn't really evolve into anything better from the film scenes. Mulan doesn't earn the respect of the others like she did in the original.-they cut Shang's character into two, which messes up the storyline and doesn't hold any emotional weight when they find the village is burned. It lacked any meaningful scenes. In the original, Shang finds his father has died and a doll is left behind. They take the time to mourn.-Mulan and her love interest don't share any meaningful scenes together.-the whole ""chi"" theme doesn't add anything because it seems like it was thrown in. ""Mulan has chi. She is a good fighter. When she lies about being a man, it makes her weak. "" It just makes it more convoluted.-stupid cliches in the film. ""4 ounces can carry 1000 pounds.""
-omitting all the meaningful lines that worked (cherry blossom adversity, the mountain doesn't bow to the wind)
-construction fighting scene, not even gonna go into detail about how bad the whole setup was. Basically, the villain captured the emperor and tied him up.

I loved this version, the differences made it feel more real and it doesn't deviate from the main course of the animated movie, a story about a woman in a man's world. Even though I loved it the storyline was not as strong as it could have been, making the film appear incomplete. There were a lot of magnificent scenes but cut short and I didn't even notice how almost a two-hour film went by in a blink of an eye. It would have been perfect if it had one more hour for more character development, fighting sequences, and mainly one of the exquisite additions the channeling of the chi needed to be explored more.I like both versions but I dare to say I prefer this one over the animated one because this film caught me off guard with so many emotions and there were scenes that tears left my eyes without notice, even remembering scenes have me teared up. What hit me hard was its main theme in which was acceptance and the perspective was not only to be accepted but to also accept oneself, to be true. It was magical how powerful this word expands beyond the story of this film, the longing to belong in such a complicated world. The weak storyline doesn't take away the spirit of the film.The composer Harry Gregson-Williams sets a magical atmosphere and his music build up the lead character's true self.The cast was phenomenal every single one, especially the lead female actor Liu Yifei. She gave life to Mulan and a whole new meaning, a performance that left me wanting more. I also have to give praise to Gong Li as the witch, I didn't expect to be so engaged with her storyline.

Even though I've not finished to watch it yet, I think I am pretty sure I know how it'll develop, think of The Wall with Mat Damon, with some of the fighting of ""Crouching tiger and hidden dragon"" if you have not seen either then it is a decent effort by Disney production, and the story of Mulan, the kick ass girl warrior who impersonated a man to help her father is already a winner, don't expect to much and enjoy",NEGATIVE,0.9252353310585022

The film is actually very good. If you're looking for a live action film à la Aladdin, the Lion King, this isn't for you. Whilst I absolutely adore those retellings, I fully respect them for going in a different direction with this. The action sequences are amazing to watch and the story adapts well to a live action adaptation. Yes, I would've loved to have seen Mushu, and all the classic songs, but the film works without them.The cinematography is excellent throughout, and the costumes and set are sublime, as you'd expect. There are few historical updates Disney have made which work well too.Having said all of this, I do find that the characters aren't as well defined in this version of Mulan. Whereas in the original, Mulan's soldier friends are fairly well set out and identifiable for their personalities, the same cannot be said for the characters in this film, and at times they can seem two dimensional. But don't let that put you off too much!All in all, it's a great action/adventure film that carries the spirit of the original tale, and the message of Disney's classic.

The chase goes such way that they end up climbing to a roof, The chicken flies off it and she is falling off it and both land on their feet/paws. I thought that was well done, nice! Everyone in the movie did a 'I am so ashamed of you' look and walked away. The worried dad speech results in give up your chi/life force energy gets spoken off. Looks like woman are only good to find a husband, lay down with him and bear children. Thank you Disney for teaching me this.Then she goes to replace her dad in the army. Has trouble to sleep between the men, so she won't end up having to sleep with the men. Thank you Disney for teaching me this. Training in the army goes on and she reconnects with her chi.We see a battle and we see a strategy explained by a wise general as a coward move... and we all know... that's not it general. Why did you not stay in general school. Then the lets strap in these breast ends up saving a life. She sees snow on a hill. I see the plan and I am thinking no one is that stupid. But the enemy army is without brains. Then returning to the army another you can only make babies, rest of you is useless. Thank you Disney for teaching me this.

2020-09-04 00:00:00,"Though there will invariably be those who complain that this isn't a shot-by-shot remake of the 90's version, I absolutely loved Disney's live action Mulan! Having been to Western China and New Zealand where the stunning landscapes were filmed, I'm admittedly disappointed that I didn't get to see Niki Caro's vision on IMAX (first world problem of the month). Unlike in the animated classic, every role in this version is played by an actor of Asian with Yifei Liu being cast perfectly in the role of Mulan (it would have been awesome if Ming-Na Wen would have been cast as Mulan's mother). Mandy Walker's cinematography during the fight sequences utilizes a few Crouching Tiger, Flying Princess (yes, I did say PRINCESS haters...so don't at me) elements in the use of red in the costuming is stunning. The score ties the film back to the original with Christina Aguilera returns two decades later to update ""Reflections"" as well as belting out ""Loyal, Brave & True"" (I will be shocked if the latter isn't nominated for an Oscar). While it did feel like it lagged in a few scenes, the message it sent is still resoundingly class. Just like its animated predecessor, Mulan provides yet another example of a strong female Disney character for young girls to show them that they don't need to sit around waiting to be rescued by a prince...indeed, it shows that while women are too easily dismissed as weak...when given the opportunity, they can rise to be strong leaders for others to follow and save a nation...a message that children and adults should hear. Those whining about not being animated classic are idiots...the real original story goes back more than 1500 years and didn't involve a magical dragon...and yet, no one whined en masse about Disney ruining the Chinese ballad. Regardless, there's room in my Mulan loving heart for both versions of this movie!",POSITIVE,0.9978196620941162
2020-09-04 00:00:00,"I enjoyed this film so so so much. Instead of being a copy-and-paste animation to live action Disney remake, this rendition of Mulan is a totally refreshing retelling of the original. The storyline follows a similar narrative, yet it takes a grittier and more action-packed approach, showing breathtaking cinematography throughout the journey. A new addition to the movie, *villainess* Bori Khan, is a 'reflection' of women with power, same with Mulan, and the film shows how differently it implements their place in society. The GIRL POWER moment that they both join forces, although it is cheesy, is a great lesson for young audiences.
There are a fair few rough spots and *eye roll* moments, but I'm thrilled to see a Disney live action remake finally take on its own course, instead of regurgitating their originals. Thoroughly enjoyed.",POSITIVE,0.999767005443573
2020-09-04 00:00:00,"Got to say really liked the creativity of this movie I thought they had no chance replacing the animated style with something watchable but they pulled it off. The ending was spoilt to me by a group of so called ""rebels"" who thought it was funny to pull a fast one on an old timer. Not that I had anything against them - I've accidentally spoiled endings to movies before (even on the night of my WEDDINGS DOH!).The use of colour was fantastic and I was really sold on the female to male transformation as it looked passable as a cool dude I'd grab a beer with. But not in China. The wars would have been far too distracting to possibly enjoy some thousand year old Chinese brew. I really liked the scene where she climbed up the pole, showing off how she could do it and nobody else could. I was reminded of my high school days of climbing a rope, jumping jacks and a 15-20 minute cooldown depending on how hard I push myself, which is usually to the max.Although I do have to take some points off, the screen wasn't nearly as big as the last Disney remake that I watched. Thanks to my daughter, the 65"" flatscreen in the garage was smashed from when SOMEBODY threw a house party without my knowledge. SOMEBODY knows that it was very wrong, and quite frankly has ruined 90-100% of my free time (WATCHING TV). Thanks to that SOMEBODY who I promised the wife would remain nameless, I had to watch Mulan on the 52"" in the family room. This of course (as anyone with a family knows) was a complete disaster. There was simply no time to get fully immersed in this classic movie.Furthermore I had noticed a few mistakes in the chorography which meant I was briefly removed from the moment. I know it's hard not to set a foot out of line, especially being on the set for such a long amount of time, but when you pay upwards of £30 to view in the first place you expect the best. I'm sure any fellow mapping enthusiasts are aware of the issue, so I won't be explaining any more (GOOGLE!).Overall I liked the movie and I think it kept a lot of the originaly magic Disney had already created all those years ago (my god, where does the time go), I think that there were some serious improvments to be made when it comes to the chorography, and I have to add that the actors (WHOM I RESPECT GREATLY) didn't bring anything new to the characters as I expect they had been directed to.To conclude I deem this to be a six out of ten. Glad to zone out for a while, but while the TV is being repaired had to squint a bit after my daughter only went and broke the bloody thing.",NEGATIVE,0.9972563982009888

2020-09-04 00:00:00,Critics showering this with praise are wrong. I could barely get through this movie without fast forwarding. Acting is wooden all around. The lead actress looks like she's just reading off a script. The pacing is slow and the story bland. It's completely humorless with no musical song and dance. Best way to describe it is it's soulless. And the fight scenes do not redeem it either. If you've seen any of Jet Li's late 80's and early 90's movies it's intense with edge of your seat action and gorgeous fight choreography. The climactic ending battle was short and boring and frankly does not cut it in 2020. I kept thinking there would be another more exciting fight at the end but nope. Some platitudes of wisdom were uttered and then The End. On the positives the costumes and cinematography are beautiful but that alone cannot save this movie.Mulan has a similar feel to that Keanu Reeves' movie 47 Ronin which was also terrible but at least I did not fall asleep in the theater and it is a bit better than Mulan. What's surprising is this $200 million budgeted movie does not look or feel like a $200 million movie. Effort was clearly put into creating colorful visuals but the story at its core is hollow and the lack of humor robs it of the original's charm. It's too serious and the weak fight scenes and choreography just sinks this movie. No it's not worth $30.

Even the acting was alright. It's just the story...I'm all for feminism, but this was just TOO much. Where was the romance? Where was the comedy? Where were the songs? Why didn't they make it as a musical, like the remake of Beauty and the Beast? I just don't understand the choices in this. This could've been great, but they wasted it all just to give us ANOTHER feminist message, with a second random female ""enemy"" warrior, that didn't make any sense. Why not just let Mulan be the only female warrior, it was way more powerful that way. And where was Mushu, and the other characters that gave the original so much humor and life?I never write reviews, but I just had to for this one because I appreciate the original so much and I'm SO disappointed.

2020-09-04 00:00:00,"If the idea behind Mulan 2020 was to make a more realistic and modern take, they failed horribly. They took out so many things of made the original good, that the movie is simply something else. It gave me no sense of nostalgia, no scenes were taken literally, not even the music! Nothing like how fun Aladdin was.For starters there is no way a woman could hide her period in those times. She was sleeping for months inside a tent with all the other soldiers. What would she do with the soiled cloth? Where would she procure more? How would she avoid getting soiled mid training? Really, there was no need to be such a stickler to things being realistic, because the story simply can't be told that way.By taking out the songs that said a lot about the characters throughout the movie and the fun that Mushu provided, they killed many of the scenes that really brought secondary characters into light and helped develop them. The trial she overcame in the cartoon movie required thinking, using her smarts and her newfound strength. How did she do it here? Concentrating her chi? Utter nonsense. Also, Mushu and Cricket saved her from many close calls. It made sense that she would need help hiding her identity.Why did they cheapen her love story? Her relationship growing throughout the movie was so important, and the fact that he was her officer was important as well! Where they afraid it was feminist enough? That her love interest was in a position of power above her looked bad for the press?The role of the witch felt like ti was there simply because there weren't enough relevant women. And since she couldn't be evil, she had to be a subjugated, misunderstood, powerful woman that in the end died for Mulan because she had triumphed where the elder woman had failed. Oh, come on! Why not make Mushu a female phoenix? Would have made more sense!Anyhow, it has a few touching moments, but felt overall like a bad press movement trying to update a story that worked to make it fit into a modern narrative and destroying its essence in the process.",NEGATIVE,0.9941626787185668

Growing up with Disney, I was worried it would be nothing like the cartoon, but I was wrong to be worried. Whilst the movie isn't the same, it still has aspects that reminds you of the cartoon. It is not a childish animation, but a true work of art that can allows people to appreciate the legend.

First of all, it's Woke (of course it is), but that's only the start of the problems. Sometimes they have lame fighting styles, other times they just randomly throw in something out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and not in a good way, but it's all really boring. They also took out all the interesting characters, like Mushu, Shang, Cricket, Mulan's grandmother, Mulan's 3 army friends, and instead we get these pointless nobodies who have little to no role other than simply being there. They even gave Mulan a sister, but she adds absolutely nothing; you can take her out of the movie and it changes nothing. Oh, and there's no Shan Yu either, instead we get these two generic, boring villains with no character. And let's not forget the inclusion of chi and actual magic and witchcraft. And, of course, Mulan is an overpowered Mary Su who, even as a child, was performing moves that would put Jacki Chan to shame. I mean, why not give her actual development in training and stuff to show her becoming a good fighter when you can just make her super OP Mary Sue right off the bat, right? The acting itself is bland, and even the dialogue is horrible. Everyone talks in these tone-deaf monotone voices with no emotion in them. You really feel nothing for any these characters. The movie has none of the charm of the original, and they don't even have any of the songs. Seriously, the movie is an utter disaster, and completely boring.

2020-09-04 00:00:00,"Mulan (the original animated) has always been a personal favourite of mine, from the witty jokes and comments of Mushu to the plot empowering equality between a highly divided target audience of the time.
The motion picture remake (Mulan 2020) was outstanding in many ways but uncomparable to the original at the same time. Disney took on a much more mature approach with the live action remake and I think it worked well. Lion King showed us that frame by frame remakes were not going to work well and I think that this movie found a sweet spot (still not without its faults).
At times the movie did seem bland and lost character, I personally was not a fan of how disney portrays Mulan as more of a ""super hero"" rather than the intelligent witty female lead she was in the original.
What did work well - a lot more than I was expecting. Originally I was not very happy about the idea of Mushu no longer being in the movie but after watching the story arch and the clearly more mature audience nature the movie is targeted for I can completely see why this decision was made. The soundtrack has to be one of the best that Disney has ever done, personally I would place it above some of the more ""singy"" disney originals however others may differ. The movie also holds my highest respects in terms of cinematography, choreography however in parts the CGI just felt a bit off for me - however still not awful.
I would recommend this film to friends and family, however I would recommend they use my account rather than paying the £19.99 early access fee in the UK (nice one disney).",POSITIVE,0.9969540238380432

The fundamental problem with all these remakes of late is that they are remakes. it's pretty much a lose/lose situation. Great movies are passion projects that set out to be nothing other than what they are. Trying to 'live up' is an insurmountable detriment, especially when you're dealing with nostalgic sentiment as strong as Disney renaissance films hold.
You can just hear the pitch meetings while watching this. ''Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon meets Disney renaissance heartstrings''.
If I want to see CTHD, I'll watch CTHD. If I want to see Disney renaissance heartstrings, I'll watch one of my favorite classics for the seven hundredth time.
Disney, please stop underestimating and disrespecting your audience. We deserve better for sticking with you through all these years.
This was a fine watch, and honestly not all bad. I got the witch/scorned dog storyline and I think it's probably the best route you could have gone. But nobody is asking for not bad.
Here's one for you: have some of your own medicine and be loyal, brave and true. Make art, take chances, surprise us.

I missed Mushu, the music and villains, who were very creepy and threatening in the original. This movie felt very much like a Disney+ production, not something I could imagine in the cinema and I found it hard to connect with the characters and the story, sometimes finding myself bored. Without the iconic music, both the instrumental score and the Disney songs, the emotional moments failed to pack as much of a punch.

What really made the original character great was the fact that she achieved everything through intelligence and hard work. If you take that from her, she is virtually another character.
Then, I didn't really feel the acting. In some scenes I was expecting some emotion from the actors but they just kept a straight face and I really disconnected from the scenes.
Also, a few very important scenes from the first film were omitted or downplayed a lot. Take the scene where Mulan leaves for war for instance. I blinked and it was over.
From what I understand they got rid of Mushu and all the songs to make the movie more realistic, but yeah they added a witch and magic, which of course are a part of daily life (if you live in Harry Potter).
I was expecting epic battle scenes, but they really felt weird? Like Avatar the Last Airbender level of weird.
However I really enjoyed the costumes and the scenery, so the movie isn't fully irredeemable.
I wouldn't have mind the fact that it isn't a lot like the original if the movie was done right, but I felt that Disney got rid of all the parts that made the original great and I am truly unhappy with the result.

This film was not enjoyable to watch, I really wanted to like it but it's so inferior to the classic it's frustrating. I loved the classic, and I know the director said she wanted to make it more realistic by cutting out Mushu but she still includes mystical characters and flamboyant fight scenes (that were very unrealistic). Why cut out what made the classic so enjoyable? The film doesn't have the strong impact the classic has, they skim over important moments and Mulan barely grows throughout the film. While they try to present some good lessons, they gloss over all of these important moments and so you really don't feel anything during this movie except frustration. The villains aren't menacing and make the stupidest choices that favor the protaganist. The characters who you know are meant grow into close friends are all awkward and don't seem close at all. And somehow the film just drags on - it felt like forever to get through. I'm not saying it should have had musical numbers or Mushu, but they had the opportunity to present a great Chinese tale about female empowerment yet somehow created a boring film that lacks impact, creativity and strong direction.",NEGATIVE,0.9974348545074464

Do not expect upon beginning it to see the exact same as the 1998 original. This is a more mature story and a closer insight on rigid societal systems and how they are historically unfair to certain categories. Despite what the 'member-days nostalgists spew, it is better, as it is closer to a real-life legend. While incorporating unrealistic elements, they can be tolerated, as all good stories change their form and style, while remaining true to their core message. Let us not forget that the original Mulan story was NOT written in 1998, but is so old and has become so archetypal that we still cannot pin its exact origins. To me, the 1998 film was both fun and a slap in the face of the real legend. They went the right way in the live-action remake, removing all of the childish jokes (including Mushu and his stand-up routine) and focusing on the legend and its message. It does right by the original story. Not a verbatim retelling of the 1998 story, for kids who forgot to grow up, but an outstanding example for all of us. As all great legends are.I do not give this film a full rating because of the untimely and improper release. It should have been further postponed, as it was already overdue. The format in which it is made available does it little justice, and the theatrical release would have also been impossible given our current worldwide situation.

I cannot say they are bad, far from it, but they just don't seem very enthusiastic acting. Maybe it's because they were all speaking English, honestly I do not know hahaha. Also, was the emperor opening his mouth to a voice that was not his own?Very bizzare. I really didn't like that they swapped Mushu with that phoenix who looked a bit like a paper kite in my honest opinion and we couldn't even get a good glimpse of him.Now The Good: Mulan VS Xian Lang dinamic. Great!!! The jin jang paralell was spot on. Their scenes were show stealer.
Hounghui was the cutest ever. I fell in love. I really liked they had a very subtle budding romantic relationship with no kiss. Honestly, that was perfect. And feminism was well handled here, just like messages about devotion to a family and how daughters can look after their fathers too. That was heart-warming. Cinematography is beautiful, as well.Overall, they tried, but while I could watch Aladdin on repeat (not the perfect movie sure) here, I have few memorable scenes to come back to and no characters that are dear to me.

I'm telling you to just go watch it. This movie was indeed very different than the cartoon but it also had all the characters and many nearly identical scenes to the original movie. Other than that, there is a kind of version of Mushu in the film that is summoned by the father the same way he did when mushu was sent by the ancestors. The difference is that he is a Phoenix instead of a Dragon and he does not speak. He guides Mulan throughout her journey and empowers her. Mulan is also a lot more powerful in this film than in the original. She is the one to reveal her own true identity to her men because she felt she needed to embrace the virtue of truth in order to fully embrace her power. She isn't caught like in the original. As far as music goes? Absolutely not. That would have completely ruined this film. The tone of this movie is a bit more serious than your typical Disney live action remake. It's a war movie. It has its light hearted moments but the overall tone is serious. There is one scene where they speak the lines to one of the songs. The score includes the original music but no singing. The stunts and fighting in this movie were also extremely good. There were stunts in this movie done on horseback I've never seen done before. As a general rule I don't think Disney really shows blood in any of their movies and even though this movie is very violent, you never see any blood. The fighting and scenes of dead soldiers could be quite frightening for little ones so be careful about watching this one with very young children.

It has action, drama, romance, fantasy, and Martial Arts!!!! I recommend everyone see this movie it is great for families. But let me say that this movie will push those boundaries of PG-13.
From here on is a spoiler stop here if you wish to remain in the dark.....From the opening scene until the final heart twisting end this movie is great. When she is chasing that chicken and showing off what she can do was great. The addition of Jason Lees Character and the ""Witch"" are great surprises in this film. There are many great actors in this film that and seeing several that I know from previous films and TV were a great shock to me as for the first time in a movies history I did not want to spoil anything about it before I personally got a chance to watch it.
The fighting scenes were well done!! They were both fantasy and real all blurred together. I have seen many Martial Arts films in my life and although this will never be called a Martial Arts film, it does have that feel about it without stepping to far away from the Disney feel. My final thoughts are this... this is what I image a live action version of animation being and I really hope that Disney looks to this as a new stepping point for movies of this nature!!!!!!",POSITIVE,0.999725341796875

What's even more rare is that this movie is focused on female martial arts. It's smooth, beautiful and powerful. In terms of literary drama, Mulan's and father's emotions poke me, and the screen is as usual as Disney's dream, but it's not the same.

Liu yifei's acting is very good, from a young girl, after a variety of experiences, grow into a soldier. The eyes are funny.

The characters were beautiful portrayed, even with the changes from the '98 version.Fans may be mad because there isn't any musical songs throughout, and I get that, but they've done it well with the stunning instrumental pieces that appear in the background, that resonate the songs we know and love.You won't be disappointed though, as Christina comes back and outdoes herself with a fresher rendition of Reflection, and the new song Loyal, Brave, True in the credits.There are so many differences to the original, and so many things they kept the same. It was a great addition for the movie and it kept you thinking as you already know the story, but not the fine tuning and added action that was coming!I think this movie was very tastefully done and compliments the '98 version nicely.

If you like all the new Disney remakes where they squiz any part of nostalgia out of you and remove all the magic that made Disney Disney,
so you will love this movie.Also if your among the 5% who know the real folklore story of mulan before Disney changed it, you will also love this movie as it follows the ""real"" or should i say the ""authentic"" story much closely.but there was a reason Disney changed the real story the way they did !
Disney took the original story and added what i can only describe as ""magic"" in it. bright colors, love story, music, and fun.
so yea.. NONE of these exists in this one.I had so much hope for this movie as a huge Mulan fanbut really Disney should have really kept it unpublished, as ad least i would think it's amazing.This story is just the folklore story of Mulan and lacks all the magic that Disney put to make that story pop and amazing.
if you want a real drama just watch any other story that follows a folklore tale there is 9999 better movies that does that (hell there is even 152 movies for Hansel and Gretel that tries to follow the ""real"" folklore and i'm ashamed to say some of them are better then this one).it was Obviously set for cinema with huge sound parts that can come out as amazing if you would hear them with a surround system in full volume on a 10m screen, but come out as a bit flat on normal TV with normal sound.
same goes for the amazing effects, that just look as normal effects in normal lcd screens.so what you get when you watch it at home is:
a medicare movie with good effects, ok songs and decent acting... nothing more, and def. not worth the 30 usd .yea if i would see it in the cinema i would get
great songs in surrounds, with great detailed effects, and just a fun way to pass 90m. and maybe worth the 8usd cinema ticket.so for home ? 3\10 easy .

Even for the audience who wanted to escape from daily hardships and virus scare, such Disney/Chinese marriage could not help. To glorify a chinese hero at this wrong time with a brainless movie as such is next to impossible.

2020-09-04 00:00:00,"I'm Asian so I would like to think I am the target audience of this movie. My biggest problem is that the movie has clearly been managed to death. The script has no heart at all. And Liu Yifei, as pretty as she is, being the blandest of bland actresses, brings no emotional depth to the role.",NEGATIVE,0.9997627139091492
2020-09-04 00:00:00,"I found the movie did its best to establish a decent story at the beginning but as the movie went on it just went off the rails, the decision to cut up action sequences and employ random camera moves took me out the movie quite often. storywise it made a decent effort but a lot of plotlines just were left hanging or ended abruptly without much explanation afterwards. The main issue i had was how a live action movie could possibly be less realistic than the cartoon, the original is a movie set in reality with a bit of mythical stuff but this one was just off its head and i think it tried to do too much to distance itself from the original it lost its way. Also the witches death? that was just anticlimactic and did disjustice to her character.",NEGATIVE,0.9996659755706788

2020-09-04 00:00:00,"I don't care what anyone says but i really liked the movie. There were a few noticeable flaws In the dialogue, story and action, but even with them i still enjoyed it and to me Yifei Liu was an amazing Mulan",POSITIVE,0.999721348285675
2020-09-04 00:00:00,"Cinematography was nice, credits music was really good! A few decent easter eggs in the dialogue and at least the cast wasn't whitewashed. That's where the pros end for me.Songs or no songs, the story shed all the lovable, fun moments the animated movie had. It was a serious, somber film where important, deep topics were sort of just presented rather than revealed through character and plot development. Mulan's character wasn't as relatable because of this. While the animated version had her be a normal person who worked extra hard, struggled like heck, and use her mind to overcome challenges, much of the live-action Mulan's skills was just chalked up to her innate chi. [Why? Who even knows? Sounds of exasperation].I do not think the actors are bad but the movie seemed to be lacking emotional depth on some choices (for example, the quickness at which the army accepted Mulan being revealed or the witch's change of heart seemed rushed). But this may be due to the director's questionable choices...other questionable choices include: excluding the highly popular comic relief, Mushu, and having a phoenix guide instead, leaving out Mulan's turning point in the army (y'all remember the epic scene during I'll make a man out of you where Mulan climbs that tall post with heavy medallions around her wrist to retrieve that arrow?), making the lucky cricket a random soldier named Cricket, a sister who is scared of spiders (quite possibly to only cause the bug uproar at the matchmaker's), and no cray, slightly thirsty, but super lovable grandmother?Not much more to say. Just going to have to rewatch the animated version again.",NEGATIVE,0.9944748878479004
2020-09-04 00:00:00,"The vivid colour and sweeping imagery set the film above and apart from the usual Disney offering. The characters are simply drawn and the plot was never going to be more than a sketch, but there is humour, subtleties and references that that kept it interesting till the end.As simple as an adventure or as complex as a Father/Daughter tale of honour, the film is worth the money to watch it.",POSITIVE,0.9997676610946656

2020-09-04 00:00:00,I'd probably give this an 8 but I'm bumping up to a 9 to counter the snowflakes that give a film a bad review because they weren't happy that the film wasn't what their il informed expectations were. This film was not meant to be a real life version of the original. It's a new take on the story and it was done so so well. The casting is so great and the performances are beautiful. Don't go into the film expecting the original but find joy in the small nods to it that they make. Really great stuff and made life in lockdown a bit more enjoyable.,POSITIVE,0.9992080926895142

Yet it falls flat all over. There is no character development. And at no point do we really develop a connection to those around her or really even what their names are. She just
Does what she does without any struggle, because brains aren't a requirement for mulan in this film, she's born with chi apparently. The ability to defy physics , arrows , swords
All with her inherit superpowers. If the film did not contain mulan in its title I guarantee this would've been straight to DVD regardless of coronavirus",NEGATIVE,0.9994603991508484
2020-09-04 00:00:00,"Why do Disney make the movie when it is nothing like the cartoon version? The characters are totally different and the story is nothing like it. She cannot act, with no face expression. It's a myth movie instead of a historical advanture.",NEGATIVE,0.997534453868866
2020-09-04 00:00:00,"Just finish streaming on Disney+ and I love it so much! As a Chinese who's also been exposed a lot to western and Disney culture, I love both how the original animated version and how the live-action 2020 take in a different way. The live-action 2020 is epic and more feminized in my opinion. The action scenes are without doubt spectacular, the emotions are also well elaborated. Mulan and her father, Mulan and Honghui, Mualn and Xianniang...I love the way they interact and the meanings behind it. I wish Disney would also consider re-release it in theaters and it surely deserves!!!!",POSITIVE,0.9998165369033812
2020-09-04 00:00:00,"This retelling of Mulan is breathtaking. The scenes are so uniquely shot. I agree that I was iffy about them not including Mushu, music, etc. However, after educating myself on Chinese culture and that Mushu was disrespectful, I understand their decision. Like stated, this movie is not supposed to be light-hearted with a bunch of fun songs. It's about war. It's about a warrior. They did a great job twisting the story into their own version, while honoring the original Mulan poem and the animated movie. As a fan of the original Mulan, I am beyond proud of this film. I laughed, I cried, and I ended the movie feeling so grateful to have experienced it. This was definitely worth the wait and paying the extra money to see it. I highly recommend!",POSITIVE,0.9995957612991332
2020-09-04 00:00:00,"Guys... it's a Disney movie, what did you expect. It still has to fit within the Disney formula, but with that, it does a fantastic job of being culturally and aesthetically authentic to China in that era.

This movie didn't go so far fetched like the Sleeping Beauty, it still follows the same story but with updated themes that's more familiar to people today.This movie was a beautiful retelling of the story. While it may not follow some of the original scenes and characters, it has its own magic of its own and has earned its rightful place as a Disney classic.As a father of a daughter Milan's representation is everything that is right about this movie.

2020-09-04 00:00:00,"Mulan is a visual feast, and nothing more. It's a bland, lifeless mess of a film with watered down stakes, poor characters, no humour, and no heart. If anything, it's shown just how masterful the 1998 animation is.Mulan was just an ordinary girl, who went on to do extraordinary things, burdened by societal constrictions and driven by love, loyalty, and honour. But this version of Mulan is wooden and hollow. There is no weight to her decisions, no urgency, because she's the chosen one. And although Disney has proclaimed this to be an empowering film for women, applying the 'chosen one' archetype to the female lead (if you ask me) is a funny way of promoting female empowerment. If anything, it's disparaging, disheartening, and a huge step back compared to it's predecessor.",NEGATIVE,0.994659960269928
2020-09-04 00:00:00,I'm absolutely blown away with how beautiful this movie was. Instead of repeating the same exact story of the cartoon from the 90s (which was riddled with issues and disrespect towards Chinese culture from Mushu to the Emperor bowing for Mulan) this version really tells a story much faithful to the original tale.

Whether or not you've seen and loved the animated Mulan of the 1990's I can imagine you falling head over heels for this splendid family adventure that empowers not only women but children in general to follow their hearts and engage in imaginative, heroic, adventure. Director Niki Caro has made a stunningly beautiful film, with dazzling colors and rich detail in every frame. She pays tribute to some of the animated film's most iconic visual moments, like the burned-out village left in the wake of the invaders, and the avalanche that helps turn the tide of battle, and Liu Yifei imbues the title role with ample heart and emotion.",POSITIVE,0.9998801350593568

I'm glad they actually stuck with the Ballad of Mulan story rather than it be a remake of the animated movie. I'm glad that most of this movie's budget went around the way the land of ancient China should be presented. The music is great, the cinematography is beautiful, the visuals are incredible, the acting is solid, the editing and sound effects are good... and that's pretty much it.I'm giving this movie a 7/10 because it's better than most of the other Disney remakes (with Beauty and the Beast being the one that I happened to REALLY like), and because there is a lot to like about it. The only thing not great about this movie is the writing and the way some things are executed. I wish they spent more time developing the characters and used more of that time to develop the villain. The villain in the cartoon movie was so well-crafted and well-written, but the villain in the remake feels like there's a whole lot missing from him.It's a solid, mildly entertaining movie overall and definitely better than that garbage Artemis Fowl movie!",POSITIVE,0.9955750703811646
