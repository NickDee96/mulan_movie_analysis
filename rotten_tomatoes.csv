"October 3, 2020","It may look like a film and quack like a film, but something's just not right with the new Mulan[.]"
"October 2, 2020","Mulan, as a character, is a wonderful role model for young girls and boys, too. She sticks to who she is and keeps her family values strong."
"October 2, 2020","The 2020 Mulan adaptation suffers from the problem that also plagued 2019's Dumbo (based on the 1941 children's classic), an update that felt more like a mummification."
"September 29, 2020","This Mulan is more straightforward than subtle. There are battles to be fought, an emperor to aid and a girl embracing her power. I wanted something more challenging, artful, disruptive."
"September 28, 2020","Cold, shallow and lackluster despite breathtaking cinematography and costume design."
"September 25, 2020","Liu pulls off all [her martial-arts] moves with vim and verve, and she conveys the essence of the story's defiantly disobedient rebel, too."
"September 22, 2020",Mulan is the best live-action film to come from Disney in a very long time.
"September 22, 2020",A live action mulan actually does lend itself to them doing some pretty great things but it's so similar to the animation with nothing that made the animation endearing [and] charming.
"September 22, 2020","Disney got it right with Mulan...this version is respectful, borrowing from the Chinese auteurs...no silly songs or talking dragon...terrific..."
"September 22, 2020","Unlike some movies in the $100-million club, Mulan puts the money on the screen."
"September 20, 2020","Although it's missing the charm and the magic of Disney's animated classic, its message of acceptance and empowerment is more vital than ever. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"September 17, 2020","The fight scenes were great, and it's entertaining...with some tone issues."
"September 17, 2020","It's trying to have its cake and eat it too, didn't quite stick the landing. But I liked it, and it will require more viewings..."
"September 17, 2020","The live-action Mulan remake has many promising parts, but fails to bring them together in a satisfying way."
"September 16, 2020","Perhaps a smidgen more humour wouldn't have gone amiss, but this is imaginative, eye-popping cinema, winningly open to the riches of Chinese culture and stirring in its feminist engagement."
"September 15, 2020","The film is drab, leaden and self-important. Stripped of songs, Mulan 2.0 lacks levity, spirit and is void of humour... Our heroine is difficult to warm to. She is presented as such a stolid ice maiden warrior there's no real vulnerability to her."
"September 15, 2020","The film is a visual masterpiece. Shot in New Zealand, it is full of rich colors and textures from start to finish. Every costume, set, and even prop is beautifully crafted, transporting viewers into a highly saturated version of sixth-century China."
"September 14, 2020","No Mushu, no songs, no problem. It's an empowering action spectacle that, although it stumbles out of the gate, is held aloft by its progressive depiction of life in the barracks..."
"September 13, 2020","Like its heroine, this is a film that forges its own path and is content to be its own magnificent creation."
"September 13, 2020","Mulan on Disney+ is not a musical and characters have been changed from the 1998 film, but it still honored the spirit of Ballad of Mulan as well as the animated feature."
"September 13, 2020","Disney's transparent desire to capitalise on the Chinese market - with a faithfully unquestioning stance - explains the watered-down adaptation, which appeases more than it excites."
"September 12, 2020","""Mulan"" raises the bar in Disney sequels. This one is outstanding. The strong, gorgeous storyline for Mulan, the female character, sets a wonderful role model for all girls worldwide."
"September 12, 2020",The transformation of a lighthearted coming-of-age story into a darker battle epic generally fails to take the material in a compelling new direction while subtly streamlining cultural specifics for mainstream consumption.
"September 11, 2020",The stunning natural vistas and jaw-dropping PG-13 action sequences make this a film every member of the family is likely to enjoy.
"September 11, 2020","Acceptably inoffensive, if less than wholly engaging. At least Liu's strong, stately Mulan is a wonderful role model for girls who aren't much interested in conformity and adhering to expectations."
"September 11, 2020","When the movie finds its groove and revels in the lush visuals and stirring heroics so widely associated with Mulan, all misgivings subside."
"September 11, 2020","While the ending feels flat and the villains lack, Mulan's strong second act pulls it ahead of the rest of Disney remake pack. It's almost perfect, but feels a bit too ""MCU"" for me."
"September 11, 2020","Director Niki Caro's modern update may take things in a different direction, but it makes Mulan a more empowering character. Thanks to her creative eye and Liu Yifei's star turn, Mulan is the best live-action Disney adaptation to date."
"September 11, 2020",Far from the most aesthetically bankrupt Disney movie of the last few years.
"September 11, 2020","It's exactly what you'd imagine a Mouse House wu xia pic might be: turning up to the party as handsomely crafted as money can buy, but lacking the innate poetic grace and artistry of a King Hu or Zhang Yimou epic."
"September 11, 2020","A movie of impressive scale and clear visual command, an effort that, for my money, far surpasses its animated predecessor."
"September 11, 2020","Mandy Walker's cinematography is strong enough to make you regret that this couldn't viably be released in cinemas, and the name Chinese cast is pretty good too, and yet, somehow, it doesn't quite work."
"September 10, 2020","While glorious to look at, the movie still feels slightly hollow. All the right pieces are there, but an emotional connection to the characters is lacking."
"September 10, 2020","Director Niki Caro expertly balances the drama, humour, adventure and action, creating a thrilling big-screen epic with potent emotional resonance and lots of female power."
"September 10, 2020","The whole film has a muscular visual flair, with sweeping camera movements and cast-of-thousands set pieces that make this Chinese legend feel truly epic."
"September 10, 2020","This Mulan may have been made for the big screen, but it is impressive anywhere."
"September 10, 2020","The best scenes, as they should be, are between Mulan and her fellow war hero father, played by Tzi Ma of The Farewell. Their relationship provides the beating heart of this gritty fairy tale."
"September 10, 2020","The movie itself feels like an anticlimax: Mulan is merely a serviceable film that's rather easy to forget. It does not live up to the expectations placed on it, nor does it make a compelling argument against its earliest critics."
"September 10, 2020",Mulan certainly enriches Disney's cultural canon.
"September 10, 2020","A homage to family, feminism, honor, leadership & the joy of being true to yourself. With tributes to Kurosawa, the samurai, martial arts and the mystery of China. Wonderful."
"September 10, 2020","While it's not a bad film, Disney should've stuck to their word and done a telling of the original story, which this was not."
"September 9, 2020",I think [Yifei Liu] did a really great job as Mulan.
"September 9, 2020",Overall it was a lot of fun.
"September 9, 2020","Popcorn cinema at best, nothing more. [Full review in Spanish]"
"September 9, 2020","Draws a lot from [China's] culture, without respecting and honoring it properly. [Full review in Spanish]"
"September 9, 2020","By now we've seen too many authentic, dynamic Chinese action movies, especially Zhang Yimou's recent Shadow and The Great Wall, to accept this dross."
"September 9, 2020","A live-action remake as flat as the surface of a wooden sword, which is immediately weighed down by a dull and predictable narrative that quickly affects the parable about identity, gender equality and female empowerment. [Full review in Spanish]"
"September 9, 2020","With Mulan, Disney shoots for more than a shot-for-shot remake of the past. The result is a little clunky at times, but compelling enough to justify its existence."
"September 8, 2020","Instead of a normal girl, this Mulan is an infallible human weapon at the service of the Chinese empire. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"September 8, 2020",So instead of doing a play by play remake of the animated film they tossed out the songs and the Eddie Murphy type comedy. Good for them for sticking with an epic adventure movie that promotes girl power.
"September 8, 2020","Mulan's unnecessary changes and additions both pad the runtime and weaken its protagonist, resulting in an overworked and underbaked slog of a film that does the original a true injustice."
"September 8, 2020","Mulan turns out to be a pleasant surprise -- that Disney's creative capacity for thematic and visual reimagination is being consistently expanded by its feminist projects, and also that the film is a potent antithesis to its predecessors."
"September 8, 2020","This is a bland retelling of the Chinese folktale, wavering between wanting to set its own identity and capturing the nostalgia for the 1998 animated version."
"September 8, 2020","In short, it's 'just fine', and you'll likely feel just as you did after Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King: wishing you were watching the original."
"September 8, 2020","This 2020 Mulan is a brave attempt at retelling the original folktale. Essentially, it removes everything the Western audience has known and loved about Mulan and dares them to find something new to appreciate, and it works."
"September 8, 2020","The body piercings via arrows and swords will definitely give the littlest ones nightmares. Heck, they kept me up all night. Luckily, all I had to do was go to Disney Plus, click on ""Mulan,"" and in no time I was fast asleep."
"September 7, 2020",Niki Caro superbly directs the best of the Disney live action remakes to date. [Full review in Spanish]
"September 7, 2020",Mulan's story always did lend itself to spectacle. ... But most significantly -- and discomforting -- [this version] gives Mulan superpowers. ... It's a shame that someone decided she needed a sprinkling of pixie dust.
"September 7, 2020","The Disney remakes have been far more miss than hit, and Mulan is one of their most massive misses."
"September 7, 2020","Disney keeps making these shot-for-shot remakes and expecting everyone not to care or notice that the magic, themes, and character development that made the animated Mulan iconic are completely missing here..."
"September 7, 2020","A grown-up adaptation. Deals with traditional values, but also progressively empowering... full potential of individual when being true to oneself, and for society to take a hard look and make changes for the greater good. No courage without fear indeed."
"September 7, 2020",Disney is offering young viewers a handy introduction to epic film-making.
"September 7, 2020","Everything about this Mulan is ironic accidentally. Whatever its intentions, its execution and the circumstances of its creation are in opposition to them."
"September 6, 2020",It would be difficult to concoct a less imaginative remake.
"September 6, 2020","Exciting, action-packed live-action remake"
"September 6, 2020","[It] improves on the story in some ways, but falls short in presenting a masterful, wire-fu epic."
"September 6, 2020","The combat set pieces are terrific, the scale of the storytelling is epic."
"September 6, 2020","It's on one-hand a harmless film and not offensively awful, but it does not live up to its potential, and makes a lot of thoroughly weird decisions."
"September 6, 2020",It's a wondrous thrill to see a Disney live-action remake take a bold stance and offer something different than a pointless rehashing.
"September 6, 2020",Mulan is an auspicious blend of battle epic and fairy tale that ought to inspire a new generation of would-be warriors.
"September 6, 2020","Overall, Mulan aims to be a sweeping, cinematic adaptation of an animated classic. But the film might miss that mark for adult audiences. Despite this, the film has a place in our discussions about positive representation."
"September 5, 2020","I'm as athletic as a bed sock but, for so many reasons, this movie made me want to do backflips."
"September 5, 2020","It's thrilling action, but there's a strong sense it would all probably look better on a cinema screen."
"September 5, 2020","[T]he action isn't so much balletic as epically generic: lots of sweeping camera moves, but no understanding of how to use them to advance the story."
"September 5, 2020","""Mulan"" is visually gorgeous with massive battle sequences and moments that rival most any martial arts epics."
"September 5, 2020","That magic isn't present here, and the action scenes don't achieve lift-off."
"September 5, 2020","The story's mystical elements, notably a fierce, shape-shifting sorceress, are handled deftly; the film never overdoses on CGI."
"September 5, 2020","Loyal, brave, and true to the spirit of both the original animated film and the legend that inspired it, but doesn't always reflect the best qualities of either one."
"September 5, 2020","Talking animals and slapstick silliness are very much out and stiff-lipped themes of family, duty and honour are in."
"September 5, 2020",I admire Disney for trying to do something different -- they didn't just make a shot-for-shot remake of the original movie -- but all of the choices they made were inferior to the original film.
"September 5, 2020","While these Disney remakes may not sit quite right with some fans of the originals, there's no denying that they're good business. And sometimes - as is the case of Mulan - they're not just good business, but good movies."
"September 5, 2020","I think I know why Disney decided to stream the movie rather than wait for theaters to open across the country. There had to have been a recognition that for all its $200,000,000 budget and promotional possibilities, this ""Mulan"" is remarkably ordinary."
"September 5, 2020",This is ultimately a father and daughter story... That emotional story gets me every time.
"September 5, 2020",Mulan is the first Disney live action remake that finds a successful balance between comfortingly familiar and refreshingly new.
"September 5, 2020","It's one of Disney's very best adaptations of their animated classics, a re-telling wise enough to keep the best parts of its predecessor while largely making the film feel very much its own achievement."
"September 5, 2020","It is a fantastic companion piece to the animated film, but also stands up as a great action movie on its own."
"September 4, 2020","Mulan is definitely one of, if not maybe the, best of Disney's live-action adaptations ... Taking the original and breathing a refreshing life into the story so it becomes its own entity."
"September 4, 2020","Dishonor on you, dishonor on your cash cow, dishonor on all these Disney remakes. Mulan deserves better."
"September 4, 2020",Satisfying but bumpy.
"September 4, 2020","[Director Niki Caro] has staged some impressive, if largely bloodless battle sequences, and demonstrated that watching leading lady Yifei Liu wielding a sword and riding a horse can be just as engaging as watching a cartoon dragon."
"September 4, 2020","Gorgeous as the sets and cinematography can occasionally be, the film still feels safely engineered to be for American audiences."
"September 4, 2020",Disney's live-action Mulan has its heart in the right place but can't quite capture the magic of its animated predecessor.
"September 4, 2020","Nostalgia is a double-edged sword that cuts both ways: it makes us excited to see the newest version, while carrying the albatross of constant comparison."
"September 4, 2020",Mulan is the hero kids need in 2020. It challenges them instead of talking down to them and is one of the better live action Disney reboots.
"September 4, 2020","The best live-action Disney reboot, period. Thrilling battles sequences, stunning visuals, and a stellar cast including an excellent Yifei Liu in the title role."
"September 4, 2020","Mulan lacks the warmth, true inspiration , emotional connection and poignancy a filmgoer should expect from Disney."
"September 4, 2020","Mulan, however, suffers of the same affliction as other Disney live-action remakes. It's profoundly risk-averse. So you get stunning productions with no narrative edge"
"September 4, 2020","Liu is an emotional blank and between rip-roaring action scenes, sometimes the movie feels like a glum slog. Still, it's a stylish war film with a marvelous sense of place."
"September 4, 2020","This Mulan is like a dream: Curious, beautiful and instantly forgotten."
"September 4, 2020","While it doesn't quite hit a high-water mark of female-centric adventures, it's nonetheless a strong story with a powerful message for women, warriors and those who are both."
"September 4, 2020","It might have been an excellent reinterpretation, were it not so heavy-handed and, well, Disney-fied. But what remains bears minimal discernible relationship to the original, while reading too much like a basic Marvel film."
"September 4, 2020","Of the 12 live-action remakes that Disney has produced over the last decade, Mulan is easily the least Disneyesque of the bunch. That's not to say the reimagining of the 1998 animated feature is not a beautiful spectacle to behold."
"September 4, 2020","When the swords are drawn and the arrows begin to fly, there's a gem of something special to be found in Mulan."
"September 4, 2020","Apart from the lack of singing, romance, comedy and a mouthy dragon, this is just like the original. You might wonder what's left. Well, $200 million buys a lot of scenery and sets and quite a few stars. This new version has spectacle in mind."
"September 4, 2020","Caro's remake hits the elements of a good Wuxia movie, including gravity-defying stunts, striking colors and gorgeous natural settings. It also goes deeper on the empowering elements of the original."
"September 4, 2020","Niki Caro has finally topped her 2002 coming of age tale Whale Rider. With a superb cast, Mulan is a masterful live-action version of the 1998 animated hit."
"September 4, 2020","While Mulan has some wonderful action sequences, the stiff story and lack of charm leaves much to be desired."
"September 4, 2020","It's far more dynamic and alive than most of the other remakes, and it honors the spirit of the original while heading forward into some interesting, modern new directions."
"September 4, 2020","It's an efficient retelling of a tale about a young Chinese woman discovering her power -- affecting at times, occasionally quite lovely, but earnest, often clumsy, and notably short on joy."
"September 4, 2020",A surfeit of talent and good intentions only go so far when your lead character ends up less flesh and bone than her cartoon predecessor.
"September 4, 2020","Mulan is more than just a spectacle; it's a moving, rousing piece of art."
"September 4, 2020","Directed Niki Caro, working from a screenplay by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver and Lauren Hynek & Elizabeth Martin, strikes exactly the right balance between emotion and action."
"September 4, 2020","The best I can think of for an explanation about the overall slogginess here is that the concept of Mulan really, really needs songs and talking animals."
"September 4, 2020","Director, Niki Caro, has created an epic film, with meticulously choreographed stunts and battle scenes shot with precision on both geometrically defined and lush locations."
"September 4, 2020",Liu carries the film fearlessly - whether it's the quieter emotional moments or being badass on the battlefield.
"September 4, 2020","I enjoyed Mulan, but I couldn't avoid the sense of disconnect inherent in watching a wuxia-style period piece with Chinese actors speaking accented English dialogue."
"September 4, 2020",A robust period epic with visual grandeur to spare... [director Niki Caro] fashions an epic that keeps the Disney spirit while standing out as well.
"September 4, 2020","Its roughly 900-year-old hero remains inspirational. As the wise old Emperor said in the original film, ""You don't meet a girl like that every dynasty."""
"September 4, 2020","Don't expect to sing along with catchy songs but expect to fall in love with Mulan all over again. The film is emotional, beautifully shot, and all-around enjoyable."
"September 4, 2020","If someone were to do a shot every time a character mentions ""honor,"" they would surely die of alcohol poisoning before the credits roll under a new recording of ""Reflection"" from Christina Aguilera."
"September 4, 2020",Mulan delivers a straightforwardly heroic narrative of a capable woman battling her way to respect. It just doesn't have much else to add.
"September 4, 2020","Disney's ongoing foray into rehashing its existing classic properties as Live-Action remakes has seemingly done the unlikely with ""Mulan,"" namely by giving its new incarnation a reason to exist."
"September 4, 2020","It's an amazing cinematic achievement, buoyed by amazing action sequences"
"September 4, 2020","Even the movie's stagiest moments seem perfectly suited to the spectacle Caro creates; stunning vistas of sand dunes, majestic snow-capped mountains cities popping with colour and scenes of jaw-dropping choreographed battles."
"September 4, 2020",Caro's Mulan is a spectacle and it's too bad it won't be shared across big screens.
"September 4, 2020","Mulan is a visually stunning cornucopia cinematic feast with breakout stars who takes no prisoners in the form of Yifei Liu and Gong Li. Kudos to Niki Caro for bringing a mature, fresh spin to a classic beloved tale."
"September 4, 2020","An astonishing update to the animated classic, Mulan is a colourful and vibrant movie with bombastic battles and heroine with a ferocious heart. Entertaining for all."
"September 4, 2020",Mulan sidesteps the usual shot-for-shot route that many of its predecessors took.
"September 4, 2020","Niki Caro does a fine job with drama and action, but I just wonder what the final product would have looked like if an Asian director and writers-under Disney's guidance-had been at the helm."
"September 4, 2020","For a film with so much at stake, Mulan never feels epic, but it does succeed as a story of a young woman courageously defying cultural and social expectations."
"September 4, 2020",It is no longer easily recognisable as a family film. Nor is it a grown-up action film.
"September 4, 2020","It's a step-up effort for a Disney's live-action remake over the tepid triple-whammies of last year's ""Dumbo"", ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King""."
"September 4, 2020","The theme of being true to yourself shines through, and there is much to enjoy even if the movie doesn't quite have the emotional pull to provoke laughter and tears."
"September 4, 2020","With both respect to what's done and commitment on what can be done, this Mulan is an epic delight - as much as the 1998 film and as its own entity."
"September 4, 2020",[Mulan] lives up to the themes of its predecessor while also cutting its own forcefully dynamic path.
"September 4, 2020",There is something about the reality of Mulan being a real-life teenage girl that changes the dynamic of the whole experience. Director Niki Caro never mocks... never goes for the easy gag.... never forgets that her Mulan is a real life young woman.
"September 4, 2020","[T]he film tells a fine, rich, and empowering story, respectful of its characters and a tradition of filmmaking that matches its tale quite well."
"September 4, 2020","Mulan cracks the code of being an excellent remake, while still honoring fan favorite moments of the original film. Although not a musical, the score still packs a punch."
"September 4, 2020","Closer to director Nikki Caro's touching, both mythic and intimate ""Whale Rider"" than it is to the animated musical with Eddie Murphy as a quippy little dragon."
"September 4, 2020","Director Niki Caro ... handles the fight scenes ... and dramatic moments with equal aplomb, though some of the additional effects ... feel less well-designed."
"September 4, 2020","I enjoyed and was entertained by this offering from start to finish. I imagine many impressionable young girls will be similarly entranced. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)"
"September 4, 2020","...a fleet-footed, live-action adaptation of the 1998 animated hit. But this wartime, period-set, epic fantasy isn't the transcendent classic it might have been."
"September 4, 2020","With its CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN JEDI meets YENTL shtick, is a really great riff in what came before while unafraid to do things in new way."
"September 4, 2020",Won't satisfy the musically-inclined but it's more traditional mindset means it can stand on its own.
"September 3, 2020","A wonderful piece of filmmaking, with absolutely gorgeous choreography, elegant design, a euphoric score and impeccable cinematography... a respectful, traditional take on the tale quite easily makes this one of Disney's best remakes to date."
"September 3, 2020","The visuals are the best thing about the film, the spectacle a dazzling distraction from some of the weaker elements of storytelling and performance."
"September 3, 2020",Little girls everywhere will be inspired.
"September 3, 2020","This live-action version of the 1998 hand-animated feature is stunning to take in, most notably the set design and stunts, though the leap to a more epic and spectacular format has nipped some of the wonderment and depth of character."
"September 3, 2020",I am extremely impressed with the work that Niki Caro delivers here.
"September 3, 2020","The film is simple enough (and inoffensive enough) for children, yet possesses ample thematic depth and technical imagination to engage adults."
"September 3, 2020",It's performed with such consummate precision and showmanship that at times you would swear you were watching something with a heart.
"September 3, 2020",Mandatory moralizing mutes Mulan's majesty
"September 3, 2020",A lavish form of lip-service.
"September 3, 2020","Has the perfect set up and the correct approach to make Mulan the best of Disney's live-action remakes; unfortunately, never reaches any of the heights it has set for itself"
"September 3, 2020",Where Mulan falls short is in its emotional depth. There simply isn't much. This is the rare Disney film which may not send its viewers reaching for a tissue.
"September 3, 2020","Mulan is a cinematically stunning, live-action remake that accentuates action over heart, but the message it conveys, one of female strength and ingenuity as well as value, cannot be overlooked."
"September 3, 2020",It discards the stuff that didn't work and wasn't necessary the first time around keeps and improves upon the stuff that did work and the result is a film that is unquestionably better and more exciting to watch.
"September 3, 2020","Visually, the Mulan remake is not a masterpiece, but it gets the job done well in all the right places. The main way that the movie lags is how the personalities of the characters are watered-down from the original Mulan movie."
"September 3, 2020","It's a bold reinvention of the family-friendly Disney classic, and even if it falls short in certain areas, it's far more welcome than just another carbon copy."
"September 3, 2020",This is the best live action version to date.
"September 3, 2020",Easily the best of the Disney remakes so far. Director Niki Caro boldly evokes Chinese wuxia films to breathe new life to the legendary tale. [Full Review in Spanish]
"September 3, 2020",Liu brings the strength to the character that is needed for the film to work.
"September 3, 2020",An inferior reflection of the original.
"September 3, 2020","There are several volumes of sophisticated feminist theory at work, but, trust me, they are wholly in the service of a first-rate action-adventure film that puts characters ahead of spectacle."
"September 3, 2020","Its origins date back centuries, and its animated predecessor is beloved within the '90s Disney canon, but the latest version of Mulan couldn't be more relevant, vital, and alive."
"September 3, 2020",A transformative fairy tale with all of the high-flying swordplay of a wuxia epic.
"September 3, 2020","Mulan is a perfectly fine live-action adaptation, delivering some Disney magic and gorgeous visuals, but it's ultimately just an average action movie."
"September 3, 2020","Mulan is a solid Hollywood action movie with some Hong Kong flourish, and if it makes some 2020 kids discover real Kung Fu movies, that's great."
"September 3, 2020","Like the phoenix, 'Mulan' triumphantly rises and doesn't get lost in translation."
"September 3, 2020","You can feel the heart of it in every moment, even during the action scenes, which were handled with stunning precision."
"September 3, 2020","Now, this is my kind of Superhero movie. Disney's live action remake is more than Marvel-ous, it's a sweeping, inspirational and beautifully made film, one any family can and should enjoy."
"September 3, 2020","The colorful ""Mulan"" is striking in its visual beauty and production design. (Special kudos to Australian cinematographer Mandy Walker.) ""Mulan"" deserves to be seen on as big a screen as possible."
"September 3, 2020",Caro's Mulan carries the same emotional weight of the prior with a greater dramatic punch.
"September 3, 2020",Mulan is a soaring epic that will thrill global audiences.
"September 3, 2020","The actors capture the spirit of the beloved characters they are portraying... The action is spectacular, but the film feels rushed at times."
"September 3, 2020","Adds nothing new to the familiar story, but it's an engaging ride that never outstays its welcome and instead delivers a tale well told."
"September 3, 2020",Mulan is one of the few Disney re-makes that is overall a better film than the one it was based on.
"September 3, 2020","Mulan is not only the best Disney remake yet but perhaps better than the original. A bold statement, but one we stand by."
"September 3, 2020","While director Niki Caro significantly improves Mulan's classic story with her live-action narrative, the film's tone is inconsistent. It doesn't take enough risks to feel completely fresh."
"September 3, 2020","Its simplistic tale is effective, but lacks authenticity."
"September 3, 2020","Of all the live-action Disney adaptations, Disney's ""Mulan"" had the most potential. Instead, it ends up feeling like just another Disney movie, and not a very good one either."
"September 3, 2020","The international cast is nothing short of great, led by Yifei Liu's movie star turn as a boundaries-shattering, stereotype-defying hero-warrior for her time and for ours."
"September 3, 2020","Despite all my nit-picky complaints and how defensive I am about the 1998 Mulan and my initial low expectations of this live-action, I have to admit that I enjoyed it both as a standalone movie and as an homage to the animated film."
"September 3, 2020","[Director Niki Caro] never lets the battle scenes drown out the drama, finding inventive ways to keep the conflict visually interesting."
"September 3, 2020","Caro delivers a sumptuous event film with an excellent cast and newfound fierceness, giving the remake some additional heft as it details an unusual quest for identity and honor."
"September 3, 2020","Disney's new 'Mulan' presents a rousing role model for little girls ready to move beyond sleeping beauties, little mermaids, talking teapots and pumpkins that turn into coaches."
"September 3, 2020","""Mulan"" is good storytelling, if a little generic, with a solid femme theme that will entertain. It has been a long time coming, so expectations run high."
"September 3, 2020",A live-action remake not quite equal to an illustrious predecessor.
"September 3, 2020",A compelling and engaging adventure that represents not only an effective retelling of the 1998 film but arguably the best of the studio's animated-to-live action reconstructions.
"September 3, 2020","With sweeping scale, spectacular action, and a dynamic lead in Yifei Liu, Disney's live-action Mulan updates the original in surprising, mostly-effective ways while still maintaining the spirit of its predecessor."
"September 3, 2020","Mulan is spectacular below the line, with vivid colors and fight scenes, making for one of the more successful live-action remakes for Disney."
"September 3, 2020","While carried by a strong lead, Mulan stumbles through poor pacing, thin characters, and VFX issues that kept it an arm's length from the superior 1998 animated counterpart."
"September 3, 2020","Stuck in a battle of wills between an American sensibility, the Chinese legend, and the spectre of a previous film. This battle extends to every arena of the film with the exception of the acting and gorgeous costume work."
"September 3, 2020",Mulan was not as swift as the coursing river and did not have the strength of a raging fire.
"September 3, 2020","Brazenly pilfering the recent Skywalker saga (also owned by Disney), this Mulan has mutated into a slightly less interesting version of Daisy Ridley's Rey..."
"September 3, 2020","Martial-arts epic is more intense, violent than original."
"September 3, 2020","No music, no Mushu, no problem. Don't expect the animated Mulan and focus on the beautiful story of a father and warrior daughter who make mistakes and forgive each other."
"September 3, 2020","Yes, I missed the 1998 animated film's catchy music and talking animals - Eddie Murphy as a joking dragon called Mushu might be tough to swing in 2020 - but I was swept away by the breathtaking Chinese backdrops and high-stakes battles."
"September 3, 2020",Caro's take is one of the most beautiful films you'll see all year.
"September 3, 2020","My favorite addition to the movie is the character played by Gong Li, Xianniang. Between Xianniang and Mulan there's an antagonistic relationship, but also one of quasi mentorship. They are two women in a men's world. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"September 3, 2020","In Niki Caro's ""Mulan,"" that story elegantly and energetically moves forward, a timeless message made for right now."
"September 3, 2020","A big-budget, big-hearted adventure aimed directly at minority girls who all too often feel left out of the conversation."
"September 3, 2020","Stories about women bravely going against the cultural and social grain can be delectable catnip, and it's no different here."
"September 3, 2020","A tour de force! Nothing like the animated film, but that allows this Mulan to stand on its own. Gong Li's character is inspired. A strong script & excellent action!"
"September 3, 2020","Little girls might be better off sticking with the cartoon for now; but this opulent, ambitious production and Liu's focused, intrepid performance at its center, gives them something to grow into."
"September 3, 2020","A briskly efficient action movie of meticulous transnational appeal, one that is only now and then clearly working on tiptoes."
"September 3, 2020","Not exactly for the ages, but.. flamboyant and thrilling."
"September 3, 2020",It's best enjoyed if you're expecting a solid tween movie rather than a monumental cinematic landmark.
"September 3, 2020",An entertaining if straightforwardly glossy action-adventure from the Disney workshop.
"September 3, 2020",A beautifully layered and stunning martial arts adventure full of intricate action set pieces and a truly compelling premise.
"September 3, 2020","""Mulan"" is a spirit lifter, and though it doesn't arrive as planned, it could not arrive at a better time."
"September 3, 2020","Epic in scope and extravagant in its production design, Mulan would clearly have been a joy to experience in the theater, and it's a shame the world has changed so much over the last few months that audiences won't have that opportunity."
"September 3, 2020","While the film pays homage to the original, it stands on its own and feels more like a superhero movie about a young woman embracing her power than a film about a Disney princess."
"September 3, 2020","Is it going to save Hollywood? No, probably not. But it might save your Friday night, and that's not nothing."
"September 3, 2020","""Mulan"" isn't just the best adaptation Disney has done from its animated catalog, but one of the most resonant family dramas in a long time."
"September 3, 2020",Fuses Disney and wuxia values with a pretty good success rate.
"September 3, 2020","In the end, ""Mulan"" 2020 stands as an inspired oddity: A reenvisioned remake that improves on the original even as it owes everything to movies that have come before."
"September 3, 2020","This new iteration of the story is bold enough to go in a very different direction from the cartoon, take bigger risks in changing the source material and deliver some genuinely gorgeous cinematography and action."
"September 3, 2020","Technically, the movie is incredibly well made. I didn't have much to connect to on a story or character level."
"September 3, 2020","Liu has enough charisma for a lead performance, but the script gives her no depth and no meaningful relationships to work with."
"September 3, 2020","Despite its PG-13 rating, a rarity for a Disney release, Mulan feels like a watered-down version of a potentially captivating story."
"September 3, 2020","Mulan handily clears the bar set by live-action duds like The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, but it still fails to recapture the magic of the movie it's adapting."
"September 3, 2020",Stunning deep reds from costumes and scenery almost make up for the bloodless swordplay and performances.
"September 3, 2020","The movie does frustratingly little with its noteworthy upgrades on the original, resulting in a version of the story that's only superficially more sophisticated."
"September 3, 2020",Walt Disney's Mulan remake perfunctorily recycles the worst aspects of the 1998 animated version and roundly fails to convincingly execute the few deviations that it does attempt.
"September 3, 2020","It's a remake of the 1998 film that reaches for bold choices, but feels too timid to ultimately make them worthwhile"
"September 3, 2020","It's fast-paced but the editing feels overdone, and there's a lack of heart as nothing is left to sit."
"September 3, 2020","If anything, Mulan looks nothing like a $200 million blockbuster, but an oddly sanitised B-movie that may well be the worst Disney live-action movie to date."
"September 3, 2020",She's the Chosen One-basically an East-Asian Harry Potter but instead of the Boy Who Lived she's the Girl Who Lived As A Boy For A Couple of Weeks.
"September 3, 2020","Though Liu holds her scenes well, we barely even know Mulan. She's a mere cipher-an emblem with which a huge studio can pat itself on the back, proud to offer this lukewarm plate of inspirational content before moving on to the next whatever."
"September 3, 2020",Mulan is a mixed bag that does some things incredibly well but most of the film occupies the middle of the road.
"September 3, 2020","At least fans will be able to be mildly disappointed in the comfort of their own homes, and be able to hit pause if they get a little drowsy."
"September 3, 2020","You don't realize how important those catchy songs are for character building until they're ironically ""cut"" from the film. Beautiful visuals and action can't ever replace good storytelling."
"September 3, 2020",[Its] respectful solemnity sometimes gets in the way of the just-shy-of-great remake Mulan's attempting to be.
"September 3, 2020",Lacks the unwavering compelling beats the original had but delivers an effective beautiful-looking drama with admirable heart and a unique serious tone.
"September 3, 2020","Broadly speaking, ""Mulan"" has largely honored the story while establishing its independence from the prior version, a delicate operation that succeeds in measured doses."
"September 3, 2020","While it's still unmistakably a Disney film, with its uncomplicated character arcs and picture-prettiness, it's also at its core a moving story of a young woman finding her strength."
"September 3, 2020","The Mulan remake walks on eggshells the entire time, juggling Caro's attempts to tell a cohesive story about identity with what was decided on by committee."
"September 3, 2020","Mulan does what it can to carve its own path (however familiar), and succeeds as more than just a reflection."
"September 3, 2020","Featuring colorful production and costume design to enhance the glorious setpieces, Mulan delivers a grand sense of adventure."
"September 3, 2020",Those hoping to see a new version of the animated movie will be disappointed. This Mulan has its own feel and texture.
"September 3, 2020",There's an undeniable soul to Mulan that is as rooted in Chinese culture and folklore as it is in the animated movie we've all come to love. It's truly the best of both worlds and I'm just disappointed I can't see it in theaters.
"September 3, 2020",Caro offers and accomplishes far more with Mulan than Mulan asks of her.
"September 3, 2020","Mulan's cast is filled with action powerhouses, but it doesn't quite utilize them in the way they should be. Yifei Liu is given a great spotlight as a leading talent, but her fellow cast members aren't afforded the same, which is bittersweet"
"September 3, 2020","While it's definitely a different experience than its predecessor, and maybe not for all little ones, you can't knock its fantasy style or inspiring adventure."
"September 3, 2020","Mulan isn't what we've come to expect from Disney's live-action remakes - it's far more sober, meditative, and refined."
"September 3, 2020",Disney's live action reimagining of their 1998 animated classic has epic sweep in a story of empowerment of the human spirit. A superb cast of Chinese stars makes this a welcome new take on a time-honored tale.
"September 3, 2020","Not everything works, but the crucial element - Mulan's relationship with her father - works wonderfully well."
"September 3, 2020",Mulan blends the Chinese legend with the Disney magic in a way that's respectful of both--but it's still very much a big screen film
"September 3, 2020","It is epic, it is breathtaking, it is grand."
"September 3, 2020","This is the first time I've seen one of these Disney remakes and thought it kind of, maybe had a reason to exist. It's not the soulless cash grab The Lion King and The Jungle Book were."
"September 3, 2020","Although Mulan doesn't recapture the magic of the original animated film, it at least gives the story a new voice. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"September 3, 2020","It's well-made and worth seeing, but it's so afraid of offending or being accused of being disrespectful that it never cuts loose and comes off as patronizing."
"September 3, 2020",Mulan updates its story for a slightly older audience and its battle scenes are dynamite.
"September 3, 2020","MULAN is brilliantly conceived and executed, along with being visually stunning. From the first frame until the last, it is a feast for the eyes woven through this amazing story of female power as a tribute to the rich beauty of Chinese culture."
"September 3, 2020","Niki Caro's boldly reimagined, battle-laden saga belies its Disney status and spotlights the multifaceted star power of Liu Yifei. The result is a live-action remake done right."
"September 3, 2020",Niki Caro breathes new life into a lush adaptation that follows the original without being dragged down by imitation.
"September 3, 2020","Mulan is a classic hero(ine)'s tale, exhilarating in its elaborate set pieces and large-scale ambitions even when the smaller human story within it sometimes falls short."
"September 3, 2020","This is a fresh, contemporary update to the original film even if it's not set in modern times."
"September 3, 2020","The mostly Chinese, English-fluent cast is brilliant. The film is also a great testament to the importance of family. Mulan's courage, dedication and intelligence should be an inspiration to young girls everywhere."
"September 3, 2020","Mulan serves as a decent live-action adaptation in terms of production quality and is bolstered by good performances, especially Liu Yifei's."
"September 3, 2020","A fun, albeit western, take on the classic Chinese Wu Xia genre."
"September 3, 2020","""Mulan"" might even inspire some kids to dip their toes into all that Asian cinema has to offer, which would be the best possible outcome. But something has to give in this blind fealty to the animated films, because it's getting in the way of greatness."
"September 3, 2020","This MULAN brings honor to us all with its beautiful cinematography, epic battle scenes, and a familiar, yet distinct tale."
"September 3, 2020","Caro's mirrored reflection of the 1998 masterpiece is smeared with the former's fingerprints, however, it still delivers uplifting, powerful potency."
"September 3, 2020","Why is it that so many of Disney's 'live action' remakes look so artificial, as if they've been mostly animated themselves?"
"September 3, 2020","Dazzling vistas, costumes, and effect, together with solid performances make up for a mostly straight-forward and not risky story, but one that sends good messages to kids nevertheless"
"September 3, 2020","One could complain that hardly a single frame feels original, but there's no denying how striking it all looks."
"September 3, 2020","2020's the perfect time for the tale of a hero who overcomes arbitrary, unfair restrictions and embraces her inner warrior."
"September 3, 2020","[I]f you strip away the things that make this such an unusual release in such an unusual year, you'll find a pretty good movie and one that approaches this story with heart and with fresh eyes."
"September 3, 2020","Unlike other Disney remakes, the issue with Mulan isn't that it hews to the formula too closely; it's that when this movie veers away from that formula, it tries to be something approaching a Marvel movie, and that's one crossover we still don't need."
"September 3, 2020",Mulan is by far the best of live-action Disney remakes as it takes a familiar story and twists it to create something with absolutely stunning cinematography and great fight scenes that truly makes it feel new and epic.
"September 3, 2020",Niki Caro brings the cultural ballad from a prior place of uneven song-and-dance lip service to a proper epic of empowering sweep where actions speak louder than words.
"September 3, 2020","Had me tearing up almost as much as every single time I've watched Caro's debut, Whale Rider."
"September 3, 2020",By far the best Disney live-action adaptation yet - though the bar wasn't exactly high.
"September 3, 2020","A beautiful retelling of the legend. Niki Caro's direction is splendid, while Liu Yifei is outstanding in the lead. Disney's best live-action adaptation to date. [Full review in Spanish]"
"September 3, 2020","""Mulan"" is a stirring and majestic adaptation of the cherished 1998 animated movie with spectacular action, remarkable visuals and heart to boot."
"September 3, 2020","A stunning and authentic new take on this iconic character, Mulan's villain is a weak point, but the uplifting, action-packed live-action remake is a journey worth taking and comes cheap at the price for $29.99."
"September 3, 2020","Extremely different from the original animated classic -- and that is OK. It is still a magical and powerful story filled with girl power, and it does the classic proud."
"September 3, 2020","I adored the animated Mulan, but the best I can say for this one is it's pretty enough, and watchable."
"September 3, 2020",A lot of humorless action with no songs.
"September 3, 2020","Though an improvement on the animated original and boasting splendid action scenes, Mulan is hampered by a flat, unemotive lead performance."
