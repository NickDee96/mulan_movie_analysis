2020-10-02,"Mulan, as a character, is a wonderful role model for young girls and boys, too. She sticks to who she is and keeps her family values strong.",POSITIVE,0.9998540878295898
2020-10-02,"The 2020 Mulan adaptation suffers from the problem that also plagued 2019's Dumbo (based on the 1941 children's classic), an update that felt more like a mummification.",NEGATIVE,0.9996042847633362
2020-09-29,"This Mulan is more straightforward than subtle. There are battles to be fought, an emperor to aid and a girl embracing her power. I wanted something more challenging, artful, disruptive.",POSITIVE,0.9945637583732605
2020-09-28,"Cold, shallow and lackluster despite breathtaking cinematography and costume design.",NEGATIVE,0.9998056292533875
2020-09-25,"Liu pulls off all [her martial-arts] moves with vim and verve, and she conveys the essence of the story's defiantly disobedient rebel, too.",POSITIVE,0.9994160532951355
2020-09-22,Mulan is the best live-action film to come from Disney in a very long time.,POSITIVE,0.9998452067375183
2020-09-22,A live action mulan actually does lend itself to them doing some pretty great things but it's so similar to the animation with nothing that made the animation endearing [and] charming.,POSITIVE,0.5475726127624512
2020-09-22,"Disney got it right with Mulan...this version is respectful, borrowing from the Chinese auteurs...no silly songs or talking dragon...terrific...",POSITIVE,0.7099941372871399

2020-09-16,"Perhaps a smidgen more humour wouldn't have gone amiss, but this is imaginative, eye-popping cinema, winningly open to the riches of Chinese culture and stirring in its feminist engagement.",POSITIVE,0.9998526573181152
2020-09-15,"The film is drab, leaden and self-important. Stripped of songs, Mulan 2.0 lacks levity, spirit and is void of humour... Our heroine is difficult to warm to. She is presented as such a stolid ice maiden warrior there's no real vulnerability to her.",NEGATIVE,0.9997537732124329
2020-09-15,"The film is a visual masterpiece. Shot in New Zealand, it is full of rich colors and textures from start to finish. Every costume, set, and even prop is beautifully crafted, transporting viewers into a highly saturated version of sixth-century China.",POSITIVE,0.9998593330383301
2020-09-14,"No Mushu, no songs, no problem. It's an empowering action spectacle that, although it stumbles out of the gate, is held aloft by its progressive depiction of life in the barracks...",POSITIVE,0.9987495541572571

2020-09-13,"Mulan on Disney+ is not a musical and characters have been changed from the 1998 film, but it still honored the spirit of Ballad of Mulan as well as the animated feature.",POSITIVE,0.9997323751449585
2020-09-13,"Disney's transparent desire to capitalise on the Chinese market - with a faithfully unquestioning stance - explains the watered-down adaptation, which appeases more than it excites.",NEGATIVE,0.9887855648994446
2020-09-12,"""Mulan"" raises the bar in Disney sequels. This one is outstanding. The strong, gorgeous storyline for Mulan, the female character, sets a wonderful role model for all girls worldwide.",POSITIVE,0.9998871088027954
2020-09-12,The transformation of a lighthearted coming-of-age story into a darker battle epic generally fails to take the material in a compelling new direction while subtly streamlining cultural specifics for mainstream consumption.,NEGATIVE,0.9979774355888367
2020-09-11,The stunning natural vistas and jaw-dropping PG-13 action sequences make this a film every member of the family is likely to enjoy.,POSITIVE,0.9998583793640137
2020-09-11,"Acceptably inoffensive, if less than wholly engaging. At least Liu's strong, stately Mulan is a wonderful role model for girls who aren't much interested in conformity and adhering to expectations.",POSITIVE,0.9996456503868103

2020-09-11,"While the ending feels flat and the villains lack, Mulan's strong second act pulls it ahead of the rest of Disney remake pack. It's almost perfect, but feels a bit too ""MCU"" for me.",POSITIVE,0.9982743859291077
2020-09-11,"Director Niki Caro's modern update may take things in a different direction, but it makes Mulan a more empowering character. Thanks to her creative eye and Liu Yifei's star turn, Mulan is the best live-action Disney adaptation to date.",POSITIVE,0.9998597502708435
2020-09-11,Far from the most aesthetically bankrupt Disney movie of the last few years.,POSITIVE,0.9985970258712769
2020-09-11,"It's exactly what you'd imagine a Mouse House wu xia pic might be: turning up to the party as handsomely crafted as money can buy, but lacking the innate poetic grace and artistry of a King Hu or Zhang Yimou epic.",NEGATIVE,0.9993110299110413

2020-09-10,"The best scenes, as they should be, are between Mulan and her fellow war hero father, played by Tzi Ma of The Farewell. Their relationship provides the beating heart of this gritty fairy tale.",POSITIVE,0.9998382925987244
2020-09-10,"The movie itself feels like an anticlimax: Mulan is merely a serviceable film that's rather easy to forget. It does not live up to the expectations placed on it, nor does it make a compelling argument against its earliest critics.",NEGATIVE,0.9985898733139038
2020-09-10,Mulan certainly enriches Disney's cultural canon.,POSITIVE,0.9998062252998352

2020-09-09,"A live-action remake as flat as the surface of a wooden sword, which is immediately weighed down by a dull and predictable narrative that quickly affects the parable about identity, gender equality and female empowerment. [Full review in Spanish]",NEGATIVE,0.9996898770332336

2020-09-08,So instead of doing a play by play remake of the animated film they tossed out the songs and the Eddie Murphy type comedy. Good for them for sticking with an epic adventure movie that promotes girl power.,POSITIVE,0.9909563064575195

2020-09-08,"Mulan turns out to be a pleasant surprise -- that Disney's creative capacity for thematic and visual reimagination is being consistently expanded by its feminist projects, and also that the film is a potent antithesis to its predecessors.",POSITIVE,0.999822199344635

2020-09-08,"This 2020 Mulan is a brave attempt at retelling the original folktale. Essentially, it removes everything the Western audience has known and loved about Mulan and dares them to find something new to appreciate, and it works.",POSITIVE,0.9996323585510254
2020-09-08,"The body piercings via arrows and swords will definitely give the littlest ones nightmares. Heck, they kept me up all night. Luckily, all I had to do was go to Disney Plus, click on ""Mulan,"" and in no time I was fast asleep.",NEGATIVE,0.9836523532867432

2020-09-07,Mulan's story always did lend itself to spectacle. ... But most significantly -- and discomforting -- [this version] gives Mulan superpowers. ... It's a shame that someone decided she needed a sprinkling of pixie dust.,NEGATIVE,0.9277186393737793

2020-09-05,"While these Disney remakes may not sit quite right with some fans of the originals, there's no denying that they're good business. And sometimes - as is the case of Mulan - they're not just good business, but good movies.",POSITIVE,0.9996913075447083
2020-09-05,"I think I know why Disney decided to stream the movie rather than wait for theaters to open across the country. There had to have been a recognition that for all its $200,000,000 budget and promotional possibilities, this ""Mulan"" is remarkably ordinary.",POSITIVE,0.9840025901794434

2020-09-04,"Of the 12 live-action remakes that Disney has produced over the last decade, Mulan is easily the least Disneyesque of the bunch. That's not to say the reimagining of the 1998 animated feature is not a beautiful spectacle to behold.",NEGATIVE,0.993951678276062
